We evaluate our approach , Multivariate Prediction Games ( MPG ), on the three performance measures of interest in this work : precision at k , F - score , and DCG . Our primary point of comparison is with structured support vector machines ( SSVM )[ 27 ] to better understand the trade - offs between convexly approximating the loss function with the hinge loss versus adversarially approximating the training data using our approach . We employ an optical recognition of handwritten digits ( OPTDIGITS ) dataset [ 17 ] ( 10 classes , 64 features , 3 , 823 training examples , 1 , 797 test examples ), an income prediction dataset (‘ a4a ’ ADULT _CITE_ [ 17 ] ( two classes , 123 features , 3 , 185 training examples , 29 , 376 test examples ), and query - document pairs from the million query TREC 2007 ( MQ2007 ) dataset of LETOR4 . 0 [ 23 ] ( 1700 queries , 41 . 15 documents on average per query , 46 features per document ). Following the same evaluation method used in [ 27 ] for OPTDIGITS , the multi - class dataset is converted into multiple binary datasets and we report the macro - average of the performance of all classes on test data . For OPTDIGITS / ADULT , we use a random 31 of the training data as a holdout validation data to select the L2 regularization parameter trade - off C E 12 − 6 , 2 − 5 ,..., 2 }.__label__Material|Data|Use

On the other hand , none of the models mentioned in the background section seem to agree with these experimental observations . Formal statistical reasoning could unravel the underlying theoretical error model that leads to the power law relationship that was observed to be at the basis of the variance versus mean dependence in replicated microarray data . A PLGEM - based method successfully detects differential expression In spite of the lack of a theoretical statistical model , the empirical model presented here has proven its Page 9 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Bioinformatics 2004 , 5 : 203 _CITE_ applicability in the identification of DEG , providing improved results under a wide range of different testing conditions . In comparison to other commonly used DEG identification methods , the proposed approach demonstrated improved specificity and sensitivity on the Latin Square data set and robustness to decreasing number of replicates on the 16iDC + LPS data set . The good performance of our proposed method is reasonably due to the fact that it relies on a global error model .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce
In this experiment we evaluated our method ’ s capability to reconstruct the evolutionary history of populations represented in the 1000 genomes dataset , which consists of whole genome sequences of 1 , 092 human individuals from 14 distinct populations . We used a trinary representation wherein each individual is represented as a vector of features corresponding to 0 , 1 or 2 . Every feature represents a known genetic variation ( with respect to the standard human reference genome _CITE_ ), where the number indicates the number of varied genome copies . We used data processed by the 1000 Genomes Consortium , which initially contained 2 . 25 million variations . To reduce dimensionality , we used the 1 , 000 features that had the highest information gain with respect to the populations .__label__Material|Data|Introduce
We will compare the new approach with the AFHMM + PR [ 26 ] using the set of statistics τ described in Section 5 . 2 .

It is often the case that interoperability can be problematic to achieve , especially for resources that have different developers or creators . Reasons for this include the following : Having to deal with such issues can be both time - consuming and a source of frustration for the developer , often requiring program code to be rewritten or extra code to be produced in order to ensure that data can pass freely and correctly between the different resources used in the application . One way to overcome some of the problems of interoperability is to adopt the use of the Architecture ( UIMA ) _CITE_ ( Ferrucci et al ., 2006 ), which aims to facilitate the seamless combination of LRs into workflows that can carry out different natural language processing ( NLP ) tasks . U - Compare ( Kano et al ., 2009 ; Kano et al ., 2011 ), which is built on top of UIMA , provides additional means for ensuring more universal interoperability between resources , as well as providing special facilities that allow the rapid construction and evaluation of natural language - processing / text - mining applications using interoperable UIMAcompliant resources , without the need for any additional programming . METANET4U is one of a set of projects ( together with META - NORD and CESAR ), which are preparing LRs that operate on a wide range of different European languages for inclusion within META - SHARE .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The single - point mutation ( E64R ) is less deleterious than mutating all 4 acidic residues ( APM ), and SNF2h remodels E64R nucleosomes - 40 fold more slowly than WT nucleosomes as opposed to 200 - fold more slowly with APM nucleosomes ( Figure 1 — figure supplement 3 ). However , this remodeling rate is still very slow relative to the timescales typically measured by smFRET , which posed two additional challenges : an increase in the number of noise events ( dye blinking , intensity fluctuations , etc ) per remodeling trajectory , and an increase in the amount of data to be analyzed . These challenges were addressed through the use of custom in - house smFRET analysis software (‘ Traces ’, _CITE_ Traces ) ( Zhou et al ., 2018 ; Johnson et al ., 2018 ; copy archived at https :// github . com / elifesciencespublications / Traces ) to streamline the analysis of large data sets , and the adaptation of a computationally fast , versatile , open - source hidden Markov model ( HMM ) library called pyhsmm to quantify the durations of the pauses ( see Materials and methods ). As shown in the example trajectories in Figure 3C , remodeling of E64R nucleosomes by SNF2h proceeds through the same alternating pause and translocation phases as does remodeling of WT nucleosomes . However , the pauses are noticeably longer with E64R nucleosomes , by at least a factor of 2 ( Figure 3D ), indicating that the acidic patch epitope , like other substrate cues , is indeed sensed during the regulatory pause phase .__label__Method|Tool|Use

It may be noted that though both ReadDepth and CBS in iCopyDAV uses the same segmentation approach , the performance of CBS is better than ReadDepth for sequencing coverage & lt ; 40 × due to the difference in data pre - treatment approaches in two cases .

The overall utility of combining host – parasite models with MTE in other systems will hinge on two factors . First , the population dynamics and interactions of hosts and parasites need to be described by an adequate model ( Eqs 1 – 3 in our system ), a problem of structural uncertainty that can be addressed by natural history knowledge and model selection statistics . PLOS Biology | _CITE_ February 7 , 2018 12 / 20 Metabolic theory and within - host parasite dynamics Second , the temperature dependence of model parameters needs to be described , requiring knowledge of both the functional relationship between temperature and a parameter ( e . g ., the Sharpe – Schoolfield model ) and estimates for each function ’ s hyperparameters ( e . g ., activation energies ). Appropriate a priori choices for these relationships and parameters can initially be informed using MTE [ 13 ] and subsequently refined in empirical studies as done here . The multiple interacting temperature dependencies of host – parasite systems complicate forecast attempts , but explicitly formulating these dependencies in models based on first principles is a key step toward a predictive framework that is both generalizable and customizable across different transmission modes , species , and regions .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

We avoid distinguishing between Argument and Non - Argument segments at this stage , instead assuming that any segments left unconnected are after the structure has been identified are Non - Argument . http :// www . nltk . org / In order to establish these links , we first consider that in many cases an argument can be represented as a tree . This assumption is supported by around 95 % of the argument analyses contained in AIFdb ( Lawrence et al ., 2012 ) as well as the fact that many manual analysis tools including Araucaria ( Reed and Rowe , 2004 ), iLogos _CITE_ , Rationale ( Van Gelder , 2007 ) and Carneades ( Gordon et al ., 2007 ), limit the user to a tree format . Furthermore , we assume that the argument tree is generated depth first , specifically that the conclusion is presented first and then a single line of supporting points is followed as far as possible before working back up through the points made . The assumption is grounded in work in computational linguistics that has striven to produce natural - seeming argument structures ( Reed and Long , 1997 ).__label__Method|Tool|Introduce

Clearly rescaling by the actual norms help reduce the estimation uncertainty . This phenomenon is more prominent when the true dot products are close to ± 1 , which makes sense because cos ✓ has a small slope when cos ✓ approaches ± 1 , and hence the uncertainty from angles may produce smaller distortion compared to that from norms . In the extreme case when cos ✓ = ± 1 , rescaled JL embedding can perfectly recover the true dot product _CITE_ . In the lower part of Figure 2 ( b ) we illustrate how to construct unit - norm vectors from a cone with angle ✓.

The enormous potential of the web as a source of material for linguistic research in a wide range of areas is well established ( Kilgarriff and Grefenstette , 2003 ), with many new opportunities created by web - scale resources ranging from simple N - grams ( Brants and Franz , 2006 ) to syntactically analyzed text ( Goldberg and Orwant , 2013 ). Yet , while the use of multilingual web data to support linguistic research is well recognized ( Way and Gough , 2003 ), cross - linguistic efforts involving syntax have so far been hampered by the lack of consistent annotation schemata and difficulties relating to coincidental differences in the syntactic analyses produced by parsers for different languages ( Nivre , 2015 ). The Universal Dependencies ( UD ) project _CITE_ seeks to define annotation schemata and guidelines that apply consistently across languages , standardizing e . g . part - of - speech tags , morphological feature sets , dependency relation types , and structural aspects of dependency graphs . The project further aims to create dependency treebanks following these guidelines for many languages .__label__Method|Tool|Introduce

If the tables contain motifs , the motif logos will always be included in a separate column . This is very useful , since rather than just listing numerous motif identifiers or names of transcription factors the user may or may not be familiar with , the logos enable users to immediately identify properties of the corresponding motifs and see similarities between them . Results from multiple analyses can be collated into “ meta - analyses ” by extracting selected columns from Klepper and Drabløs BMC Bioinformatics 2013 , 14 : 9 Page 7 of 14 _CITE_ individual analyses and combining them into larger tables .

The cells were sonicated , and an equal volume of absolute ethanol was added to fix the cells , which were stored at 4 ° C overnight ( or longer ). Fixed cells were washed twice in sterile nuclease - free water before processing for FACS or budding index . Samples for budding index analysis were resuspended in 1 mL of sterile nuclease - free water and stained with 2 µg / mL final concentration of Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen , _CITE_ ) for 2 h . Cells were then briefly sonicated , washed once in sterile nuclease - free water , and wet - mounted on slides for observation on a fluorescence microscope as described below except that single focus images were acquired . After acquisition , image files in TIFF format were automatically converted to Omero files and uploaded to an image storage server using Omero Insight ’ s importer . 60 We used composite images of the phase - contrast and Hoechst channels to score unbudded G1 cells , small - budded S - phase cells in which the bud is < 1 / 3 the size of the mother , large - budded G2 / M cells with a single aggregate of DNA ( nucleus ), and largebudded anaphase / telophase cells with an elongated nucleus in the mother - bud neck or with mother and bud both containing a single nucleus , respectively .

It has long been recognized in the image processing community that wavelet transforms form an excellent basis for representation of images . Within the class of linear transforms , it represents a compromise between many conflicting but desirable properties of image representation such as multi - scale and multi - orientation representation , locality both in space and frequency , and orthogonality resulting in decorrelation . A particularly suitable wavelet transform which forms the basis of the best denoising algorithms today is the over - complete steerable wavelet pyramid [ 4 ] freely downloadable from _CITE_ In our experiments we have confirmed that the best results were obtained using this wavelet pyramid . In the following we will describe a model for the statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients .__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce

Finally , we also use the number of words between the nominals as a feature because relations such as Product - Producer and Entity - Origin often have no intervening tokens ( e . g ., organ builder or Coconut oil ). Syntactic and semantic parses capture long distance relationships between phrases in a sentence . Instead of a traditional syntactic parser , we chose the Stanford dependency parser _CITE_ for the simpler syntactic structure it produces .

To summarize , preferences are an effective way to “ define ” the event structure to the learner , which is essential in an unsupervised setting , which may not be easy to do with other forms of constraints . Preferences are naturally decomposable , which allows us to extend their impact without significantly effecting the complexity of inference . In this section , we present our experimental results on the standard ACE05 _CITE_ dataset ( newswire portion ). We choose to perform our evaluations on 4 events ( namely , “ Attack ”, “ Meet ”, “ Die ” and “ Transport ”), which are the only events in this dataset that have more than 50 instances .

The Markov clustering ( MCL ) algorithm [ 10 ] was used with an inflation value of 2 . 2 for identifying co - expression clusters . In order to identify the functional relevance of transcript clusters , we used a combination of bioinformatics tools , literature review , as well as similarity to previously defined co - expression clusters [ 17 , 18 ]. Each co - expression cluster was examined using a number of bioinformatics tools , including gene ontology ( GO ) annotation enrichment analysis ( _CITE_ Gene Ontology database release 2016 - 04 - 23 ), pathway inspection ( Reactome , http :// www . reactome . org ; KEGG , http :// www . genome . jp / kegg ), and protein localization ( Human Protein Atlas , http :// www . proteinatlas . org ). In addition , co - expression signatures from previous studies were manually compared with clusters derived from skin , allowing the naming of some of the signatures . Clusters without GO enrichment or without similarity to previously reported co - expression signatures were further investigated by checking individual genes against the literature and the phenotypes reported for knockout mice .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Reliable blog classification is an important task in the blogosphere as it allows researchers , ping feeds ( used to broadcast blog updates ), trend analysis tools and many others to separate real blog content from blog - like content such as bulletin boards , newsgroups or trade markets . It is a task that so far has proved difficult as can be witnessed by checking any of the major blog update feeds such as weblogs . com or blo . gs . _CITE_ Both will at any given time list content that clearly is not a blog . In this paper we will explore blog classification using machine learning to improve blog detection and experiment with several methods to try and further improve the percentage of instances classified correctly .

The idea that there is a basic vocabulary composed of a few hundred or at most a few thousand elements has a long history going back to the Renaissance – for a summary , see Eco ( 1995 ). The first modern efforts in this direction are Thorndike ’ s ( 1921 ) Word Book , based entirely on frequency counts ( combining TF and DF measures ), and Ogden ’ s ( 1944 ) Basic English , based primarily on considerations of definability . Both had lasting impact , with Thorndike ’ s approach forming the basis of much subsequent work on readability ( Klare 1974 , Kanungo and Orr 2009 ) and Ogden ’ s forming the basis of the Simple English Wikipedia _CITE_ . An important landmark is the Swadesh ( 1950 ) list , which puts special emphasis on cross - linguistic definability , as its primary goal is to support glottochronological studies . Until the advent of large MRDs , the frequencybased method was much easier to follow , and Thorndike himself has extended his original list of ten thousand words to twenty thousand ( Thorndike 1931 ) and thirty thousand ( Thorndike and Lorge 1944 ).__label__Supplement|Website|Extent

The computational performance of these networks is often reported in an anecdotical manner .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce
In total , we end up with four domains ( TED , ITLSP1 , EM and ITLSP2 ), which allows us to evaluate the PAMTL algorithm in realistic conditions where the QE component is exposed to a continuous stream of heterogeneous data . Each domain is composed by 1 , 000 tuples formed by : i ) the English source sentence , ii ) its automatic translation in French , and iii ) a real - valued quality label obtained by computing the HTER between the translation and the post - edition with the TERCpp open source tool . _CITE_ Table 1 reports some macro - indicators ( number of tokens , vocabulary size , average sentence length ) that give an idea about the similarities and differences between domains . Although they contain data from different software manuals , similar vocabulary size and sentence lengths for the two IT domains seem to reflect some commonalities in their technical style and jargon . Larger values for TED and EM evidence a higher lexical variability in the topics that compose these domains and the expected stylistic differences featured by speech transcriptions and non - technical writing .__label__Method|Tool|Use

We further pre - computed the scores of candidate parent sets , which were fed as input into each system evaluated . Finally , we used the EVASOLVER partial MaxSAT solver , for inferring ordering constraints . In our first set of experiments , we compared our approach with the ILP - based system of GOBNILP , _CITE_ where we encoded ancestral constraints using linear constraints , based on [ Cussens , 2008 ]; note again that both are exact approaches for structure learning . In Table 1 , we supplied both systems with decomposable constraints inferred via projection ( which empowers the oracle for searching the EC tree , and provides redundant constraints for the ILP ). In Table 2 , we withheld the projected constraints .__label__Method|Tool|Compare
To obtain a high temporal resolution of lake - extent changes , we examined and downloaded as many images as possible with a clear view of lake boundaries . In general , about 14 – 40 images were downloaded and processed for each lake ( Tables S3 – S7 ). Most Landsat images were already geometrically and radiometrically corrected by the USGS EROS Digital Image Processing Center ( _CITE_ ). For images that required additional geometric correction , we compared and geo - referenced them with other geometrically corrected images .

This means that we have a trade - off of fast computation per iteration and slow convergence for SGD versus slow computation per iteration and fast convergence for gradient descent . Although the fast computation means it can reach an approximate solution relatively quickly , and thus has been proposed by various researchers for large scale problems Zhang [ 2004 ], Shalev - Shwartz et al . [ 2007 ] ( also see Leon Bottou ’ s Webpage _CITE_ ), the convergence slows down when we need a more accurate solution . In order to improve SGD , one has to design methods that can reduce the variance , which allows us to use a larger learning rate ηt .

Unlike most computational grammars , the Core defines analyses for phenomena not restricted to one language , but for the union of all languages for which c - profiles have been defined . ( In this respect it resembles the HPSG Grammar Matrix (‘ the Matrix ’ - see Bender et . al , and _CITE_ ); we comment on its relationship to this system below .) The mediation between the Core and the cprofiles is induced by special type files : - one file for each c - profile ( of which there are currently three , for Ga , Norwegian and Kistaninya ) - one general file , called Labeltypes , for defining CL labels as types in terms of the Core types . This architecture can be summed up as follows ( with ‘ Ga c - types ’ meaning ‘ types corresponding to the templates constituting the c - profile for Ga ’, and items in boldface being items defined inside the TypeGram system ): Thus , what communicates between the Core and the construction specifications in the CL code is Labeltypes , which in turn feeds into the language specific template definition files .__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce
Figure 2 gives one view of the type of information extracted by the collection of learned category and relation classifiers . Note the initial seed examples provided to CBL did not include information about either company or any of these relation instances . _CITE_ To estimate the capacity of our algorithm to contribute additional facts to publicly available semantic resources , we compared the complete lists of instances promoted during the Full 15 iteration run for certain categories to corresponding lists in the Freebase database ( Metaweb Technologies , 2009 ). Excluding the categories that did not have a directly corresponding Freebase list , we computed for each category : Precision x | CBLInstances |− | Matches |, where Precision is the estimated precision from our random sample of 30 instances , | CBLInstances | is the total number of instances promoted for that category , and | Matches | is the number of promoted instances that had an exact match in Freebase . While exact matches may underestimate the number of matches , it should be noted that rather than make definitive claims , our intent here is simply to give rough estimates , which are shown in Table 3 .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

( 2004 ). The dataset contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie reviews with size varying between 700 to 1000 words . As summary generation is time consuming task ( DUC _CITE_ only used 25 summaries to evaluate the performance of systems ), we picked 100 positive and 100 negative reviews randomly from the dataset and their abstract summaries are generated manually with 200 words limit as budget for evaluation . These 200 summaries are used as gold standard for estimating ROUGE scores of system generated summaries . In the experiment , the partial enumeration based greedy algorithm ( Khuller et al ., 1999 ) is used for summary generation of 200 test documents within budget of 200 words .__label__Method|Tool|Introduce

This part tests the above three algorithms with synthetic data . To make a fair comparison , some implementation details are clarified as follows : ( 1 ) Since domain transformations are not considered in Li ’ s work , we assume the synthetic data are well aligned . ( 2 ) To eliminate the influence of different optimization methods , RASL is implemented with the following four optimization methods : APG ( Accelerated Proximal Gradient ), APGP ( Accelerated Proximal Gradient with partial SVDs ), ALM ( Augmented Lagrange Multiplier ) and IALM ( Inexact Augmented Lagrange Multiplier ) _CITE_ . Moreover , since RASL is applied to one mode of the tensor , to make it more competitive , we apply RASL to each mode of the tensor and take the mode that has the minimal reconstruction error . For synthetic data , we first randomly generate two data tensors : ( 1 ) a pure low - rank tensor Lo ∈ R50 × 50 × 50 whose rank is ( 10 , 10 , 10 ); ( 2 ) an error tensor E ∈ R50 × 50 × 50 in which only a fraction c of entries are non - zero ( To ensure the error to be sparse , the maximal value of c is set to 40 %).__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

Different vendors may implement different communication protocols into their medical sensors , such as ISO , IEEE , and HL7 , each one with its own communication mechanism , data format , and so forth . To solve this problem , the IEEE approved the X73 standard [ 16 ], which provides an efficient real - time exchange method for plug - and - play operation . Due to the complexity of the X73 protocols , in the industry , currently only Continua Health Alliance ( _CITE_ ) produces a hardware which is fully compatible with this standard . In the academia , Korean scholars have reported that a sensor could be adapted to the X73 protocols by means of an extra hardware [ 17 ], but this will increase the cost of the sensor .

Since our label noise is artificial , we can also measure the misclassification rate on the unmodified testing set ( right figure ). This measurement shows a slight loss of accuracy without statistical significance . Finally the cross - training algorithm was applied to real data sets from both the ANU repository _CITE_ and from the the UCI repository . Experimental results were quite disappointing until we realized that the discarding steps tends to produce training sets with very different numbers of examples for each class . To alleviate this problem , after training each SVM , we choose the value of the threshold b * in ( 2 ) which achieves the best validation performance .__label__Material|Data|Use
Question Type ( QT ) [ 28 ]), which contains 1000 training examples and 500 testing examples . We use the CNN architecture proposed by Kim [ 22 ]. _CITE_ Like many other NLP tasks , the dataset is relatively small and this CNN classifier does not inject noise to inputs like the implementation of residual networks in CIFAR 100 , so this complicated model reaches 100 % training accuracy within a few epochs . To address this , we reduced the model complexity by ( i ) decreasing the number of filters from 128 to 64 , ( ii ) decreasing convolutional filter widths from 3 , 4 , 5 to 2 , 3 , 4 , ( iii ) adding L2 regularization with scale 0 . 01 , ( iv ) performing PCA to reduce the dimension of pre - trained word embedding from 300 to 50 and fixing the word embedding during training .

Terminological Processing The aim of the 3stage terminological processing phase is to identify and correctly classify instances of the term classes described above in section 3 . 1 . 1 . During the morphological analysis stage individual tokens are analysed to see if they contain interesting biochemical affixes such as - ase or - in that indicate candidate protein names respectively . During the lexical lookup stage the previously tokenised terms are matched against terminological lexicons which have been compiled from biological databases such as CATHS and SCOP _CITE_ and have been augmented with terms produced by corpus processing techniques ( Demetriou and Gaizauskas , 2000 ). Additional subcategorisation information is provided for multi - token terms by splitting the terms into their constituents and placing the constituents into subclasses whose combination is determined by grammar rules . Finally , in a terminology parsing stage , a rulebased parser is used to analyse the tokenisation information and the morphological and lexical properties of component terms and to combine them into a single multi - token unit .__label__Material|Data|Use

A word unit is more or less fixed and there is no syntactic interference in the inside of the word unit . In the practical sense , it is useful for the further syntactic parsing because it is not decomposable by syntactic processing and also frequently occurred in corpora . There are a series of linguistic annotation standards in ISO : MAF ( morpho - syntactic annotation framework ), SynAF ( syntactic annotation framework ), and others in ISO / TC37 / SC4 _CITE_ . These standards describe annotation methods but not for the meaningful units of word segmentation . In this aspect , MAF and SynAF are to annotate each linguistic layer horizontally in a standardized way for the further interoperability .__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce
A major challenge in examining human SNP data is assessing which variants are more likely to be involved in having damaging effects on the structure and function of a gene / protein . GeneSNP - VISTA is an interactive visual tool for highly efficient analysis of large amounts of SNP data to determine a subset that may be of relevance to Page 5 of 7 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Bioinformatics 2005 , 6 : 292 _CITE_ explaining human disease . As shown in Figure 1 , all the information about a SNP ( type , location on genomic structure , frequency of occurrence , type of amino acid change and the positions conservation ) allows a scientist to determine whether a SNP is a possible causative mutation . By providing a visually integrated representation of SNPs data with genomic structure and protein conservation , GeneSNP - VISTA facilitates the screening of causative mutations from re - sequencing of a large set of appropriate candidate genes in individuals with a given disease .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

The baseline StandardCNN means that we adopt the standard CNNS with fixed window size for summary prior representation . To explore the effects of the learned summary prior representations , we design a baseline system named Reg Manual which adopts manuallycompiled document - independent features such as NUMBER ( whether number exist ), NENTITY ( whether named entities exist ) and STOPRATIO ( the ratio of stopwords ). Then we combine these features with document - dependent features in Table 1 and tune the feature weights through LIBLINEAR _CITE_ support vector regression . From Table 2 , we can see that PriorSum can achieve a comparable performance to the stateof - the - art summarization systems R2N2 , ClusterCMRW and REGSUM .

Remark on convergence of SGD with line searches : We note in passing that it is straightforward to ensure that SGD instances using the line search inherit the convergence guarantees of SGD : Putting even an extremely loose bound ¯ αi on the step sizes taken by the i - th line search , such that �° i ¯ αi = ∞ and �° i ¯ α i < ∞, ensures the line search - controlled SGD converges in probability [ 1 ].

We also focus on active participation , such as initiating a thread or posting a reply , and not on passive participation , such as simply viewing the forum ( since such passive information is only available to administrators of the support group service ). Our data is collected from DailyStrength _CITE_ , one of the largest support group based online social networks with more than 500 support groups based on the physical and mental ailments of its users . Users in these support groups can either post , creating a new thread on a new topic , or they can reply to a thread that someone else has created . We focused on 20 support groups : Acne , ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ), Alcoholism , Asthma , Back Pain , Bipolar Disorder , Bone Cancer , COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ), Diets and Weight Maintenance , Fibromyalgia , Gastric and Bypass Surgery , Immigration Law , Infertility , Loneliness , Lung Cancer , Migraine , Miscarriage , Pregnancy , Rheumatoid Arthritis and War in Iraq .__label__Material|Data|Use

It is important to note why the HOLI pipeline was not tested in this study . First , the HOLI pipeline as referenced by Pedersen et al . ( 2016 ) was incomplete and lacked the last common ancestor designation step as well as any user guidance or documentation in the code repository ( _CITE_ 9 March 2016 version ). Furthermore , since that time , the HOLI pipeline has continued to be developed for a new study that is not yet published ( https :// github . com / ancient - eDNA / Holi ), and it may therefore be impossible to reproduce the results of Pedersen et al .

The pre - processing step connects our MRS elements to a domain ontology and it can create additional states and roles . The pipeline can be reused by other grammars from the Delph - In network . NorSource _CITE_ ( Beermann and Hellan , 2004 ; Hellan and Beermann , 2005 ), a grammar for Norwegian , is a Head - Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) ( Sag et al ., 2003 ), developed and maintained with the Linguistic Knowledge Builder ( LKB ) tool ( Copestake , 2002 ), and originally based on the HPSG Grammar Matrix , which is a starter kit for developing HPSG grammars ( Bender et al ., 2002 ). An HPSG grammar can use Minimal Recursion Semantics ( MRS ) as meaning representation ( Copestake et al ., 2005 ). In order to speed up the parsing process ( the unification algorithm ), a HPSG grammar can be compiled and run ( parsing ) with the PET tool ( Callmeier , 2001 ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce

The voltage and the conductances are nonlinearly coupled : the conductances affect the voltage , which , in turn , sets the conductances .

In order to build compact translation models , we have preprocessed the parallel corpus using different word elimination strategies so that unimportant words would be removed from parallel strings . We have also used a stoplist consisting of 429 words to remove stopwords . The out - of - the - box GIZA ++ _CITE_ ( Och and Ney , 2004 ) has been used to learn translation models using the pre - processed parallel corpus for our retrieval experiments .

Page 4 of 35 F1000Research 2015 , 4 : 1075 Last updated : 19 JAN 2016 An initial lack of tools for the analysis of data obliged the MAP community to develop a series of bioinformatics solutions for exploring the native FAST5 data ( Table S2 ) produced by the MinION . Poretools ( Loman & Quinlan , 2014 , https :// github . com / arq5x / poretools ) and poRe ( Watson et al ., 2015 , http :// sourceforge . net / projects / rpore /) are packages for converting and visualising the raw data , whereas minoTour ( http :// minotour . github . io / minoTour ) provides real - time analysis and control of a sequencing run and post - run analytics .

At the start of the session the relative positions of the MEG and EEG sensors were determined using a Polyhemus 3 - D digitisation system . Data preprocessing was conducted using the MNE , FieldTrip and EEGLAB packages . _CITE_ The data was band - pass filtered at 1 - 50Hz to remove slow drifts in the signal and high - frequency noise , and then down - sampled to 125Hz . Eye and muscle artefacts were not removed , but these lie outside the range of frequencies that were considered in the analysis described below . The analysis method first applies a time / frequency filter to select an information - rich band and interval for the distinction of interest ; a supervised decomposition to extract components of whole - scalp synchronous activity that are sensitive to this class distinction ( Common Spatial Patterns , or CSP – see Parra et al ., 2005 ; Model and Zibulevsky , 2006 ; Philiastides et al ., 2006 for examples of other applications to cognitive neuroscience ); and a general purpose machine learning algorithm ( SupportVector Machine or SVM ) that uses the resulting measures of signal power to predict the semantic class of each trial .__label__Method|Code|Use

Even as the tensor fluctuates in magnitude by more than a factor of two , the maximum absolute value of the mantissa P is safely prevented from overflowing . The cost of this approach is that in the last example P reaches 3 bits below the cutoff , leaving the top bits zero and using only 13 of the 16 bits for representing data . The experiments described below were performed on Nvidia GPUs using the neon deep learning framework _CITE_ . In order to simulate the flex16 + 5 data format we stored tensors using an int16 type . Computations such as convolution and matrix multiplication were performed with a set of GPU kernels which convert the underlying int16 data format to float32 by multiplying with κ , perform operations in floating point , and convert back to int16 before returning the result as well as P . The kernels also have the ability to compute only P without writing any outputs , to prevent writing invalid data during exponent initialization .__label__Method|Code|Use

Statistical Machine Translation and Training Dataset For our translation task , we use the statistical translation toolkit Moses ( Koehn et al ., 2007 ), where the word alignments were built with the GIZA ++ toolkit ( Och and Ney , 2003 ). The SRILM toolkit ( Stolcke , 2002 ) was used to build the 5 - gram language model . For a broader domain coverage of the generic training dataset necessary for the SMT system , we merged parts of JRC - Acquis 3 . 0 ( Steinberger et al ., 2006 ), Europarl v7 _CITE_ ( Koehn , 2005 ) and OpenSubtitles201310 ( Tiedemann , 2012 ), obtaining a training corpus of 1 . 9M sentences , con taining around 38M running words ( Table 1 ). 11 The generic SMT system , trained on the concatenated 1 . 9 sentences , is used as a baseline , which we compare against the domain - specific models generated with different sentence selection methods . Furthermore we use the generic SMT system in combination with the smaller domainspecific models to evaluate different approaches when combining generic and domain - specific data together .

BLEU should be calculated on a large test set with multiple reference texts . We used BLEU - 4 ( that is , BLEU calculated using n - grams of size up to n = 4 ) because this version of BLEU is the main metric used in recent NIST Machine Translation evaluations ( and indeed seems to have become a standard in the MT community ). We also used the NIST _CITE_ MT evaluation score ( Doddington 2002 ); this is an adaptation of BLEU which gives more weight to less frequent n - grams which are assumed to be more informative . There are several different ROUGE metrics . The simplest is ROUGE - N , which computes the highest proportion in any reference text of n - grams of length N that are matched by the generated text .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use
Document summarization is an active subject of research and development . The ACM Digital Library has about 806 reports on the subject published since 1993 , with over half of them appearing in the last five years . While the impetus for much of this research is the annual Text Analysis Conference ( TAC ) workshop on document summarization , there is a growing demand in the consumer market for news summarization applications being met by tablet and smart - phone applications such as Clipped , Summoner , TLDR _CITE_ , and Yahoo News . Yahoo and Google even acquired two companies developing such applications , Summly ( Stelter , 2013 ) and Wavii ( Tsotsis , 2013 ) respectively , earlier this year . While summarization technology for news sources is coming to fruition , the performance of such technology on non - English documents outside the news domain has not been throughly assessed and may need further research .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

On the other hand , in the sentence ( B ), the expression simply corresponds to a literal concatenation of the usages of the constituents : the post - positional particle “ に ( ni )” and the verb “ ついて ( tsuite )”, and has a content word meaning “ follow ”. Therefore , when considering machine translation of those Japanese sentences into English , it is necessary to precisely judge the usage of the compound expression “ に ( ni ) ついて ( tsuite )”, as shown in the English translation of the two sentences in Table 1 . There exist widely - used Japanese text processing tools , i . e ., pairs of a morphological analysis tool and a subsequent parsing tool , such as JUMAN + KNP and ChaSen + CaboCha _CITE_ .

Through evolution , structure is more conserved than sequence , so that detecting even very subtle sequence similarities , or remote homology , is important for predicting function . The major methods for homology detection can be split into three basic groups : pairwise sequence comparison algorithms [ 1 , 2 ], generative models for protein families [ 3 , 4 ], and discriminative classifiers [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Popular sequence comparison methods such as BLAST * Supplemental information for the paper , including the data sets and Matlab source code can be found on this author ’ s web page at _CITE_ and Smith - Waterman are based on unsupervised alignment scores . Generative models such as profile hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) model positive examples of a protein family , but they can be trained iteratively using both positively labeled and unlabeled examples by pulling in close homologs and adding them to the positive set . A compromise between these methods is PSI - BLAST [ 8 ], which uses BLAST to iteratively build a probabilistic profile of a query sequence and obtain a more sensitive sequence comparison score .__label__Supplement|Website|Produce

Opinion cues ( or Q - elements ) are words , emoticons and phrases that convey the actual attitude of the speaker towards the topics and targets , and a strength and polarity can be attributed to them , both a priori and in context .

To maintain data utility , we must balance the number of iterations and the privacy budget spent on each iteration in the training process . To use the Newton - Raphson algorithm , we need to compute the gradient and the Hessian matrix from the Ji et al . BMC Medical Genomics 2014 , 7 ( Suppl 1 ): S14 Page 4 of 10 _CITE_ data sets . The simplest way to ensure differential privacy is to add Laplacian noise to the gradient and the Hessian matrix , and use the noisy version of these intermediary results to update parameters . Theoretically , the impacts of additive noise in Laplacian mechanism ( see Definition 4 ) tend to be much smaller when the number of samples approaches infinity , as the sensitivity of the gradient and the Hessian matrix is irrelevant to the size of a data set .__label__Material|Data|Extent

Despite the preprocessing , ASSUMPTION - FREE K - MC clearly outperforms K - MC on the data sets with large values for a ( X ) ( CSN , KDD and SONG ). The additional effort of computing the nonuniform proposal is compensated by a substantially lower expected quantization error for a given chain size . For the other data sets , ASSUMPTION - FREE K - MC _CITE_ is initially disadvantaged by the cost of computing the proposal distribution . However , as m increases and more time is spent computing the Markov chains , it either outperforms K - MC ( RNA and SUSY ) or matches its performance ( WEB ).

In addition to a scriptable , command - line utility meant for gathering data for further processing , the query system also has an online interface which allows the results to be visualized and inspected in real time ( Figure 3 ).

The model captures fine - grained semantic structure and performs better when small semantic distinctions are important . CCGs map documents on a probabilistic simplex ( e . g ., ✓) and for W > [ 1 x 1 ] can be thought as an LDA model whose topics , hi , are much finer as computed from overlapping windows ( see also Eq . 10 ); a comparison is therefore natural . As first dataset we considered the CMU newsgroup dataset _CITE_ . Following previous work [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] we reduced the dataset into subsets with varying similarities among the news groups ; news20 - different , with posts from rec . sport . baseball , sci . space and alt . atheism , news - 20 - similar , with posts from rec . talk . baseball , talk . politics . gun and talk . politics . misc and news - 20 - same , with posts from comp . os . ms - windows , comp . windows . x and comp . graphics .

Agriculture and nutrition outcomes The last decade has witnessed a surge of interest in leveraging agricultural development for better nutrition . However , there is a dearth of rigorous evidence and policy - relevant research on agriculture - nutrition linkages ( Pinstrup - Andersen , 2013 ).

We compare our M - statistic with a state - of - the - art algorithm , the relative densityratio ( RDR ) estimate [ 7 ] ( one limitation of the RDR algorithm , however , is that it is not suitable for high - dimensional data because estimating density ratio in the high - dimensional setting is illposed ).

Once the corpus C has been split into two subsets C1 and C2 , each of these subsets may Algorithm 2 Splitting a corpus into two parts still contain the full set of topics but the topic distribution will differ in the two : topics similar to the first pseudo - center will be predominant in the first subset , the others in the second .

In the next sections , we assess the validity of this approach on both synthetic and real - world data _CITE_ .

Theorem 4 Given a maximum set of ancestral constraints A , and let O be a closed set of ordering constraints . The set O is entailed by A if O satisfies the following two statements : We now empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach to learning with ancestral constraints .

In our experiments , we varied the number of variables in the learning problem ( n ), the size of the training dataset ( N ), and the percentage of the n ( n − 1 )/ 2 total ancestral relations that were given as constraints ( p ). We report results that were averaged over 50 different datasets : 5 datasets were simulated from each of 2 different sub - networks , which were taken from each of the 5 original networks mentioned above .__label__Material|Data|Use
These differences yield an important consequence : VDMGP can infer automatically the latent dimensionality K of data , but SPGP - DR is unable to , since increasing K is never going to decrease its likelihood .

To summarize , preferences are an effective way to “ define ” the event structure to the learner , which is essential in an unsupervised setting , which may not be easy to do with other forms of constraints . Preferences are naturally decomposable , which allows us to extend their impact without significantly effecting the complexity of inference . In this section , we present our experimental results on the standard ACE05 _CITE_ dataset ( newswire portion ). We choose to perform our evaluations on 4 events ( namely , “ Attack ”, “ Meet ”, “ Die ” and “ Transport ”), which are the only events in this dataset that have more than 50 instances . For each event , we randomly split the instances into two portions , where 70 % are used for learning , and the remaining 30 % for evaluation .__label__Material|Data|Use

After initial experimentation , the set of features we use in the matching function is φm ( ti ) = { general - pos , entity - type , relationargument }, and the similarity function examines the remaining features . In our experiments we tested the following five kernels : We also experimented with the function C ( vq , vr ), the compatibility function between two feature values . For example , we can increase the importance of two nodes having the same Wordnet hypernym _CITE_ . If vq , vr are hypernym features , then we can define When & gt ; 1 , we increase the similarity of nodes that share a hypernym . We tested a number of weighting schemes , but did not obtain a set of weights that produced consistent significant improvements .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Chemical compound names , i . e . names of molecules , are terms which prominently occur in scientific publications , patents and in biochemical databases . Any chemical compound can be unambiguously denoted by its molecular structure , either graphically or by certain representation standards . Established representation formats are SMILES strings ( Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System ( Weininger , 1988 )) and InChIs _CITE_ . For example , a SMILES string such as CC ( OH ) CCC unambiguously describes a chain of five carbon ( C ) atoms connected by single bonds having an oxygen ( O ) and a hydrogen ( H ) atom connected to the second carbon atom by another single bond ( Figure 1 ). However , for communication purposes , e . g . in scientific publications and even in databases , it is common to use names for chemical compounds instead of a structural representation .__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce
The algorithm parameters are tuned on the development set . In order to compare our approach with a nonsequential one , we perform the classification task also using Support Vector Machines ( Vapnik , 1998 ). We use YAMCHA _CITE_ , a tool developed for chunking tasks , in which SVMs are easily combined with different context window sizes and dynamic features ( Kudo and Matsumoto , 2001 ). Since this work is only a preliminary step towards the automatic identification and extraction of biographical information from Wikipedia , we first experiment with the simplest approach . Therefore , we consider a small set of shallow features extracted only from section titles , and we ignore the content of the sections .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Identifying functional zones in email messages is a challenging task , due in large part to the diversity in syntax used by different email software , and the dynamic manner in which people employ different styles in authoring email messages .

In addition to releasing our annotated email dataset , the Zebra system will also be available for others to use _CITE_ .

GANs train two deep networks in concert : a generator network that maps random noise , usually drawn from a multi - variate Gaussian , to data items ; and a discriminator network that estimates the likelihood ratio of the generator network to the data distribution , and is trained using an adversarial principle . Despite an enormous amount of recent work , GANs are notoriously fickle to train , and it has been observed [ 1 , 19 ] that they often suffer from mode collapse , in which the generator network learns how to generate samples from a few modes of the data distribution but misses many other modes , even though samples from the missing modes occur throughout the training data . To address this problem , we introduce VEEGAN , _CITE_ a variational principle for estimating implicit probability distributions that avoids mode collapse . While the generator network maps Gaussian random noise to data items , VEEGAN introduces an additional reconstructor network that maps the true data distribution to Gaussian random noise . We train the generator and reconstructor networks jointly by introducing an implicit variational principle , which encourages the reconstructor network not only to map the data distribution to a Gaussian , but also to approximately reverse the action of the generator .__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce
By providing scalar factuality judgments for events , our models enable more fine - grained reasoning than previously considered . The corpus and learned models are available online . _CITE_ While event definitions have been proposed in several prior studies , existing approaches vary in how they model various linguistic forms such as nominal events , stative events , generic events , and light verbs ( Pustejovsky et al ., 2003 ; Palmer et al ., 2005 ; Meyers et al ., 2004 ; Kim et al ., 2009 ; Song et al ., 2015 ). Even with a formal and precise account of events , training annotators to learn all such linguistic intricacies remains a practical challenge . Instead of definition - driven instructions , we propose example - driven instructions and show their effectiveness .__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce

The SVM based on the uniform combination of these 5 kernels was found to have the highest overall performance among 19 promoter prediction programs [ 24 ], it therefore constitutes a strong baseline .__label__Material|Data|Use

Furthermore , we test the robustness of our methods by randomly reassigning the labels of 10 % of the images , and the results indicate that the SGD - WPV improves the performance of SGD - Scan even more while SGD - SD overfits the data seriously .

One such receptor is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ). The AHR is the only ligand - activated member of the Per - ARNT - Sim ( bHLH / PAS ) family of transcription factors , all of which play important roles as environmental - and physiological stress - sensing proteins [ 8 ]. The AHR has been best studied for its ability to be activated by dioxins , polychlorinated biphenyls , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [ 9 ], all of which are high priority chemicals on the U .

We know of only two such databases which can be freely accessed6 ; WALS and the library catalogue of MPI / EVA in Leipzig . WALS : The bibliography for the World Atlas of Language Structures book can now be accessed online ( _CITE_ ). This database contains 5633 entries annotated to 2053 different languages .

We sketch a formal analysis of the response categories in the framework of KoS . Responding to a query with a query is a common occurrence , representing on a rough estimate more than 20 % of all responses to queries found in the British National Corpus . _CITE_ Research on dialogue has long recognized the existence of such responses . However , with the exception of one of its subclasses — albeit a highly substantial one — the class of query responses has not been characterized empirically in previous work . The class that has been studied in some detail are Clarification Requests ( CRs ) ( Rodriguez and Schlangen , 2004 ; Rieser and Moore , 2005 ).__label__Material|Data|Use
The lexical variations of a lexical entry usually have high phonetic , string - based , and contextual similarity . We integrate a phonetic - based encoding scheme , UrduPhone , a feature - based similarity function , and a clustering algorithm , Lex - C . Several sound - based encoding schemes for words have been proposed in literature such as Soundex ( Knuth , 1973 ; Hall and Dowling , 1980 ), NYSIIS ( Taft , 1970 ), Metaphone ( Philips , 1990 ), Caverphone ( Wang , 2009 ) and Double Metaphone . _CITE_ These schemes encode words based on their sound Spell correction is also considered as a variant of text normalization ( Damerau , 1964 ; Tahira , 2004 ; Fossati and Di Eugenio , 2007 ). Here , we limit ourselves to the previous work on short text normalization . which in turn serves as grouping words of similar sounds ( lexical variations ) to one code .__label__Method|Tool|Extent
However , when there are no a priori reasons to spatially segment an assemblage , a method is needed to examine whether there is , nevertheless , spatial patterning in the data . To address this , a method for calculating and plotting nearest neighbor samples and , in effect , moving averages across an assemblage from a particular stratigraphic unit is presented . This method allows spatial patterning across an assemblage to be visualized in Benn PLOS ONE | _CITE_ January 2 , 2018 2 / 21 Statistical and graphical methods for analyzing site formation processes using artifact orientations space . When patterns are detected , the assemblage can then be spatially segmented and tested following the above mentioned techniques .

Primary ( Level 1 ) WES data was obtained to create the TCGA dat sets . To access the Level 1 DNA sequencing data for breast and ovarian tumors from TCGA , a project request was submitted and approved by the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genotypes and Phenotypes Database ( NCBI dbGaP ) Data Access Request system , Protocol # 5309 “ BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer ”. Breast and ovarian samples potentially with controlledaccess Level 1 WES binary alignment (. bam ) files were identified from the Genomic Data Commons ( GDC ) ( _CITE_ ) ( n = 1098 breast tumors and 590 ovarian tumors ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ).

This approach was entitled multiple kernel learning ( MKL ). Research in the subsequent years focused on speeding up the initially demanding optimization algorithms [ 22 , 26 ]— ignoring the fact that empirical evidence for the superiority of MKL over trivial baseline approaches ( not optimizing the kernel ) was missing . In 2008 , negative results concerning the accuracy of MKL in practical applications accumulated : at the NIPS 2008 MKL workshop [ 6 ] several researchers presented empirical evidence showing that traditional MKL rarely helps in practice and frequently is outperformed by a regular SVM using a uniform kernel combination , see _CITE_ Subsequent research ( e . g ., [ 10 ]) revealed further negative evidence and peaked in the provocative question “ Can learning kernels help performance ?” posed by Corinna Cortes in an invited talk at ICML 2009 [ 5 ]. Consequently , despite all the substantial progress in the field of MKL , there remained an unsatisfied need for an approach that is really useful for practical applications : a model that has a good chance of improving the accuracy ( over a plain sum kernel ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce
The system behavior can be controlled by passing arguments through the command line interface . For example , the user can specify which clustering algorithm should be used . To facilitate using the system for research purposes , the system comes with a clustering evaluation component that uses the ClusterEvaluator package . _CITE_ . If the input to the system contains subgroup labels , it can be run in the evaluation mode in which case the system will output the scores of several different clustering evaluation metrics such as purity , entropy , f - measure , Jaccard , and RandIndex .

To date , most meteorites recovered throughout history have been done so in Antarctica in the last 20 years . Furthermore , they are less likely to be contaminated by terrestrial compounds . _CITE_ Meteorites are of interest to space scientists because , with the exception of the Apollo lunar samples , they are the sole source of extra - terrestrial material and a window on the early evolution of the solar system . The identification of Martian and lunar meteorite samples , and the ( controversial ) evidence of fossil bacteria in the former underscores the importance of systematically retrieving as many samples as possible .

Finally , while we discuss the main application of our results in the context of advertising exchanges , our model and results apply to the broad space of platforms that serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers , and help run many repeated auctions over time . The issue of dynamic revenue sharing also arises when Amazon or eBay act as a platform and splits revenues from a sale with the sellers , or when ride - sharing services such as Uber or Lyft split the fare paid by the passenger between the driver and the platform . Uber for example mentions in their website _CITE_ that : “ Drivers using the partner app are charged an Uber Fee as a percentage of each trip fare . The Uber Fee varies by city and vehicle type and helps Uber cover costs such as technology , marketing and development of new features within the app .” We propose different designs of auctions and revenue sharing policies in exchanges and analyze them both theoretically and empirically on data from a major ad exchange .

Integrating work from psychology and computational linguistics , we develop and compare three approaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam , and ultimately develop a classifier that is nearly 90 % accurate on our gold - standard opinion spam dataset . Based on feature analysis of our learned models , we additionally make several theoretical contributions , including revealing a relationship between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing . With the ever - increasing popularity of review websites that feature user - generated opinions ( e . g ., TripAdvisor _CITE_ and Yelp ), there comes an increasing potential for monetary gain through opinion spam — inappropriate or fraudulent reviews . Opinion spam can range from annoying self - promotion of an unrelated website or blog to deliberate review fraud , as in the recent case of a Belkin employee who hired people to write positive reviews for an otherwise poorly reviewed product . While other kinds of spam have received considerable computational attention , regrettably there has been little work to date ( see Section 2 ) on opinion spam detection .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

For study # 1 , our base system ( Spitkovsky et al ., 2010b ) is an instance of the popular ( unlexicalized ) Dependency Model with Valence ( Klein and Manning , 2004 ).

The theory guiding the interpretation of SAS data in terms of structure generally assumes an effective point source and a single wavelength . The instrument setup used for a SAS experiment may be an excellent approximation to a point source , or may differ significantly from it and thus require corrections to be made to data or to model scattering profiles for comparison with the experiment . The wavelength resolution ( AX / X ) for SAXS ( whether synchrotron or laboratory - based ) is generally a good approximation to a single wavelength , while for SANS it can be of the order of 10 – 15 % in order to optimize the neutron flux on the sample ( for examples , see _CITE_ ). Beam size and shape also play a key role in data smearing . Modern synchrotron beams and most laboratory - based instruments have sufficiently small beam dimensions ( in the range of tenths of a millimetre to millimetres at the detector ) such that smearing effects can be safely ignored for most applications .__label__Supplement|Document|Produce
A single wrong correspondence between two consecutive frames may reduce the electrode ’ s score dramatically , while being unnoticed by the single frame score .

Low matching scores between the manual and the automatic clustering may result from inherent ambiguity in the data .

The authors showed that this way , the number of experiment runs to minimize a given objective can be significantly reduced while surpassing the performance of parameters chosen by human experts . We implemented our experiments using Theano [ 23 ] and pylearn2 [ 24 ].__label__Method|Code|Use

Semantic textual similarity relates to textual entailment ( Dagan et al ., 2005 ), lexical substitution ( McCarthy and Navigli , 2009 ) and paraphrasing ( Hirst , 2003 ). The key issue for semantic textual similarity is that the task is to determine similarity , where similarity is cast as meaning equivalence . _CITE_ In textual entailment the relation under question is the more specific relation of entailment , where the meaning of one sentence is entailed by another and a system needs to determine the direction of the entailment . Lexical substitution relates to semantic textual similarity though the task involves a lemma in the context of a sentence , candidate substitutes are not provided , and the relation at question in the task is one of substitutability .

The disambiguated items with high confidence correspond to more than 50 % of all the bank & apos ; bank & apos ; number & apos ; number & apos ; hood & apos ; hood & apos ; content words . As a result of the disambiguation step , we obtain sense - annotated data comprising around one billion tagged words with at least five occurrences and 2 . 5 million unique word senses . The disambiguated text is processed with the Word2vec ( Mikolov et al ., 2013a ) toolkit _CITE_ . We applied Word2vec to produce continuous representations of word senses based on the distributional information obtained from the annotated corpus . For each target word sense , a representation is computed by maximizing the log likelihood of the word sense with respect to its context .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Since the appearance of [ 10 , 11 ], considerable interest in statistical applications of the distance correlation coefficient has arisen . Notably , distance correlation has been used for inferring gene regulatory networks [ 35 ], testing associations between the copy number variations of different genes [ 36 ] and assessing associations of familial relationships , lifestyle factors and mortatility [ 37 ]. PLOS ONE | _CITE_ November 28 , 2017 6 / 23 Clustering with mixed - type data The distance correlation coefficient RðX ; YÞ is a measure of dependence between apdimensional random vector X and a q - dimensional random vector Y , where p and q are arbitrary . The distance correlation is always positive with 0 < RðX ; YÞ < 1 and it equals 0 if and only if the vectors X and Y are independent . This property implies that the distance correlation can detect any dependence between X and Y .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce
In both of the pre - training and fine - tuning stages , the loss functions are optimized with L - BFGS algorithm ( a Quasi - Newton method ) which , according to [ 22 ], can achieve fastest convergence in our settings .

At rates above 0 . 5 , saturation diminishes the signal about the true state frequencies at the root . The most accurate inference of both root and stationary state frequencies occurs at intermediate rates ( 0 . 05 to 0 . 2 ), but even in those cases , the difference between root and stationary frequencies is often underestimated . When the trees are not fixed to the true topology and very high rates are assumed ( two or more expected substitutions between root and tips ), we observe false positives in the recovery of the directional model , and the same is the case with entirely random data ( Supplementary File S4 , available on Dryad at _CITE_ ). Further analyses show that under such circumstances , that is without reliable information about topology and relative branch lengths , and in combination with an inadequate branch length prior ( we used an exponential distribution with rate 10 throughout ), the analyses recover a balanced tree with extreme directionality because this parameter combination increases the probability of observing a large number of substitutions on short branches .__label__Supplement|Document|Produce

Challenges in using source of care data for crosscountry comparisons To compare sources of care , we used the most recent DHS surveys conducted between 2000 and 2012 ; 57 countries had data available on family planning and delivery care and 47 countries had data available on antenatal care ( Appendix 1 ). We analysed five questions , shown in Table 1 , which ask respondents where they received care , and , for antenatal and delivery care , who provided it .__label__Supplement|Website|Use
Each of these images has been subdivided into sixteen non - overlapping images , obtaining a data set with 640 images . Sixteen Gabor filters were used to characterise these images , so that each image is represented by a 16 - dimensional feature vector [ 14 ]. The database extracted from the UCI repository ( _CITE_ ) consists of 2 , 310 outdoor images . The images are subdivided into seven data classes ( brickface , sky , foliage , cement , window , path , and grass ).

As mentioned in Sec . 1 , one important contribution of our method is its ability to use arbitrary deep learning generative and classification models . For the generative model , we use the C - GAN [ 22 ] _CITE_ , and for the classification model we rely on the ResNet18 [ 15 ] and ResNetpa [ 16 ]. The architectures of the generator and authenticator networks , which are kept unchanged for all three datasets , can be found in the supplementary material . For training , we use Adadelta ( with learning rate = 1 . 0 , decay rate = 0 . 95 and epsilon = 1e − 8 ) for the Classifier ( C ), Adam ( with learning rate 0 . 0002 , and exponential decay rate 0 . 5 ) for the Generator ( G ) and SDG ( with learning rate 0 . 01 ) for the Authenticator ( A ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Use
The vocabulary ( W ) was selected based on word frequency : we used the 5000 most frequent words in the corpus , excluding stop words and strings containing non - alphabetic characters . During computation of the cooccurrence tensor , OOV words were ignored ( rather than deleted ), and the context window was allowed to span sentence boundaries . Models were evaluated using reference data extracted from DiCoEnviro _CITE_ , a specialized dictionary of the environment . This dictionary describes the meaning and behaviour of terms of the environment domain as well as the lexicosemantic relations between these terms . Of the various relations encoded in the dictionary , we focused on a subset of three paradigmatic relations : near - synonyms ( terms that have similar meanings ), antonyms ( opposite meanings ), and hyponyms ( kinds of ).__label__Material|Data|Use

Given a set of m instance - label pairs ( xi , yi ), with i = 1 , ... , m , xi E Rn , and yi E {− 1 , + 1 }, learning the classifier involves solving the following optimization problem , where C & gt ; 0 is a penalty parameter . In scikit - learn , the problem is solved through a trust region Newton method , using a wrapper over the implementation available in the liblinear _CITE_ package . For multi - class problems , scikitlearn uses the one - vs - the - rest strategy .

More recently , Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis on large social media datasets have received an increasing amount of attention outside academia , where a growing number of businesses and public institutions seek to gain insight into public opinion . For example , companies are primarily interested in what is being said about their brand and products , while public organisations are more concerned with analysing reactions to recent events , or with capturing the general political and societal Zeitgeist . The social network Twitter has been a popular target for such analyses as the vast majority of tweets are publicly available , and easily obtainable via the Twitter API _CITE_ , which conveniently enables the harnessing of a large number of realtime responses to any user - defined keyword query . In this paper we are concerned with what we call agile social media analysis , which is best illustrated with an example .

Many of the major machine learning breakthroughs of the last decade have been catalyzed by the release of a new labeled training dataset . _CITE_ Supervised learning approaches that use such datasets have increasingly become key building blocks of applications throughout science and industry . This trend has also been fueled by the recent empirical success of automated feature generation approaches , notably deep learning methods such as long short term memory ( LSTM ) networks [ 14 ], which ameliorate the burden of feature engineering given large enough labeled training sets . For many real - world applications , however , large hand - labeled training sets do not exist , and are prohibitively expensive to create due to requirements that labelers be experts in the application domain .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

We calculated the read distribution in different regions including exons , introns , untranslated regions , promoters and intergenic regions derived from the genomic annotations in Ensembl ( hg19 ), and found the majority of reads fell within exons and untranslated regions , whereas only a very small proportion of reads mapped to introns . Further , these data were consistent across the samples and there were no significant differences in these overall QC values between replicate groups ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Transcript models were derived for each sample independently using Cufflinks ( v2 . 2 . 0 ; with default parameters , except to specify strand specificity ; _CITE_ ).

Nematode biology abstracts . To demonstrate the strength of the nonparametric approach as exemplified by the HDP mixture , we compared it against latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ), which is a parametric model similar in structure to the HDP [ 1 ]. In particular , we applied both models to a corpus of nematode biology abstracts _CITE_ , evaluating the perplexity of both models on held out abstracts . Here abstracts correspond to groups , words correspond to observations , and topics correspond to mixture components , and exchangeability correspond to the typical bag - of - words assumption . In order to study specifically the nonparametric nature of the HDP , we used the same experimental setup for both models , except that in LDA we had to vary the number of topics used between 10 and 120 , while the HDP obtained posterior samples over this automatically .__label__Material|Data|Use

Three distinct human summaries were produced for each chain . For each chain , one summary was produced for each of the three queries , where the person producing the summary was not shown the next steps in the chain when answering the first query . To simulate the exploratory search of the user we provided the annotators with a Solr _CITE_ query interface for each document collection . The interface allowed querying the document set , reading the documents and choosing sentences which answer the query . After choosing the sentences , annotators can copy and edit the resulting summary in order to create an answer of up to 250 words .__label__Supplement|Website|Produce
Despite the preprocessing , ASSUMPTION - FREE K - MC clearly outperforms K - MC on the data sets with large values for a ( X ) ( CSN , KDD and SONG ). The additional effort of computing the nonuniform proposal is compensated by a substantially lower expected quantization error for a given chain size . For the other data sets , ASSUMPTION - FREE K - MC _CITE_ is initially disadvantaged by the cost of computing the proposal distribution . However , as m increases and more time is spent computing the Markov chains , it either outperforms K - MC ( RNA and SUSY ) or matches its performance ( WEB ).

The score on this task was the mean response time in milliseconds across trials which contained matching pairs . Cronbach ’ s alpha for this task has previously been reported as 0 . 85 [ 11 ]. Visual memory : A visual memory test was administered , labelled ‘ pairs - matching ’ ( _CITE_ ), where participants were asked to memorize the positions of six card pairs , and then match them from memory while making as few errors as possible . Scores on the pairs - matching test are for the number of errors that each participant made ; therefore , higher scores reflect poorer cognitive function .

A human evaluation over 202 dialogue acts does not show any difference in naturalness and informativeness between BAGEL ’ s outputs and human utterances . Additionally , we find that the data collection process can be optimised using active learning , resulting in a significant increase in performance when training data is limited , according to ratings from 18 human judges . _CITE_ These results suggest that the proposed framework can largely reduce the development time of NLG systems . While this paper only evaluates the most likely realisation given a dialogue act , we believe that BAGEL ’ s probabilistic nature and generalisation capabilities are well suited to model the linguistic variation resulting from the diversity of annotators . Our first objective is thus to evaluate the quality of BAGEL ’ s n - best outputs , and test whether sampling from the output distribution can improve naturalness and user satisfaction within a dialogue .__label__Material|Data|Use

These data support the existence of a continuum of quiescence depths . It is well documented that the levels of Cyclins D and E are dramatically reduced in cells forced into quiescence via serum starvation [ 42 , 67 ]. Here we compared the dynamics of PLOS Biology | _CITE_ September 11 , 2017 15 / 25 A single - cell chronology of the human cell cycle multiple key cell - cycle proteins , including Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E , in forced versus spontaneous quiescence . In contrast to the declining levels of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E in serum - starved or contact - inhibited cells , the levels of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E rise while cells are in the quiescent CDK2low state . We confirmed this result using endogenously tagged mCitrine - Cyclin D1 and further showed that the high levels of Cyclin D1 in CDK2low cells arise because of reduced cullin - RING ligase - mediated protein degradation in the CDK2low state .__label__Supplement|Paper|Compare

Finally , our third claim is that data programming is an intuitive and productive framework for domain - expert users , and we report on our initial user studies . Relation Mention Extraction Tasks In the relation mention extraction task , our objects are relation mention candidates x = ( e1 , e2 ), which are pairs of entity mentions e1 , e2 in unstructured text , and our goal is to learn a model that classifies each candidate as either a true textual assertion of the relation R ( e1 , e2 ) or not .

Through evolution , structure is more conserved than sequence , so that detecting even very subtle sequence similarities , or remote homology , is important for predicting function . The major methods for homology detection can be split into three basic groups : pairwise sequence comparison algorithms [ 1 , 2 ], generative models for protein families [ 3 , 4 ], and discriminative classifiers [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Popular sequence comparison methods such as BLAST * Supplemental information for the paper , including the data sets and Matlab source code can be found on this author ’ s web page at _CITE_ and Smith - Waterman are based on unsupervised alignment scores . Generative models such as profile hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) model positive examples of a protein family , but they can be trained iteratively using both positively labeled and unlabeled examples by pulling in close homologs and adding them to the positive set . A compromise between these methods is PSI - BLAST [ 8 ], which uses BLAST to iteratively build a probabilistic profile of a query sequence and obtain a more sensitive sequence comparison score .__label__Supplement|Document|Produce

Recent interest in Mathematical information retrieval ( MIR ) has prompted the construction of the NTCIR Math IR test collection ( Aizawa et al ., 2013 ). Like many general - purpose , domainspecific IR test collections , the NTCIR collection is composed of broad queries intended to test systems over a wide spectrum of query complexity . In this paper we present a test collection composed of real - life , research - level mathematical topics and associated relevance judgements procured from the online collaboration web - site MathOverflow _CITE_ . The resulting test collection con tains 160 atomic questions - material derived from 120 MathOverflow discussion threads . Topics in our test collection capture specialised information needs that are complex to resolve and often demand collective effort from multiple domain experts .__label__Supplement|Website|Use

Finally , while we discuss the main application of our results in the context of advertising exchanges , our model and results apply to the broad space of platforms that serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers , and help run many repeated auctions over time . The issue of dynamic revenue sharing also arises when Amazon or eBay act as a platform and splits revenues from a sale with the sellers , or when ride - sharing services such as Uber or Lyft split the fare paid by the passenger between the driver and the platform . Uber for example mentions in their website _CITE_ that : “ Drivers using the partner app are charged an Uber Fee as a percentage of each trip fare . The Uber Fee varies by city and vehicle type and helps Uber cover costs such as technology , marketing and development of new features within the app .” We propose different designs of auctions and revenue sharing policies in exchanges and analyze them both theoretically and empirically on data from a major ad exchange . We compare against the naïve policy described above .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

Stimuli that produce bistability are characterized by having several distinct interpretations that are in some sense equally plausible . Given the successes of Bayesian inference as a model of perception ∗ _CITE_ ( for instance [?, ?, ? ]), these observations suggest that bistability is intimately connected with making perceptual decisions in the presence of a multi - modal posterior distribution , as previously noted by several authors [?, ?]. However , typical Bayesian models of perceptual inference have no dynamics , and probabilistic inference per se provides no reason for spontaneous switching , raising the possibility that switching stems from idiosyncracies in the brain ’ s implementation of probabilistic inference , rather than from general principles .__label__Method|Algorithm|Extent

Budanitsky and Hirst ( 2001 ) evaluated the performance of five different methods that measure the semantic distance between words in the WordNet Hierarchy , which Patwardhan et al . ( 2003 ) have then implemented and made available for general use as the Perl package distance - 0 . 11 . _CITE_ We focused in particular on the following three measures , the first two of which are based on information theoretic principles , and the third on sense topology : • Resnik ( 1995 ) combined WordNet with corpus statistics . He defines the similarity between two words as the information content of the lowest superordinate in the hierarchy , defining the information content of a concept c ( where a concept is the WordNet class containing the word ) to be the negative of its log likelihood . This is calculated over a corpus of text .__label__Method|Code|Introduce
This paper focuses on additional information in the form of multi - labeled data , where each document is tagged with a set of labels . These data are ubiquitous . Web pages are tagged with multiple directories , _CITE_ books are labeled with different categories or political speeches are annotated with multiple issues . Previous topic models on multi - labeled data focus on a small set of relatively independent labels [ 25 , 36 , 46 ]. Unfortunately , in many real - world examples , the number of labelsfrom hundreds to thousands — is incompatible with the independence assumptions of these models .__label__Material|Data|Use

These tags were used to manually and semi - automatically annotate the written corpus as well .

One of the advantages of corpusbased approaches is that the techniques used are less language specific than classical rulebased approaches where a human analyses the behaviour of target languages and constructs rules manually . This naturally led the way for international resource standardisation , and indeed there is a long standing precedent in the West for it . The Human Language Technology ( HLT ) society in Europe has been particularly zealous in this regard , propelling the creation of resource interoperability through a series of initiatives , namely EAGLES ( Sanfilippo et al ., 1999 ), PAROLE / SIMPLE ( Lenci et al ., 2000 ), ISLE / MILE ( Ide et al ., 2003 ), and LIRICS _CITE_ . These continuous efforts have matured into activities in ISO - TC37 / SC4 , which aims at making an international standard for language resources . However , due to the great diversity of languages themselves and the differing degree of technological development for each , Asian languages , have received less attention for creating resources than their Western counterparts .__label__Material|Data|Introduce
Major limitation of this approach is that one cannot give richer context due to the problem of scarcity . To find whether the dependency label is correct or not , apart from node and its parent information , contextual features like sibling and child information is also helpful . Current state - of - the - art dependency parsers like MSTParser _CITE_ and MaltParser use these features for dependency labeling ( McDonald et al ., 2006 ; Nivre et al ., 2007 ; Kosaraju et al ., 2010 ).

Each extracted rule is assigned a count fC . In this section we will explore variations of this rule extraction procedure involving alternative definitions of the ranking and counting functions , fR and fC , based on probabilities over alignment models . Common practice ( Koehn et al ., 2003 ) takes a set of word alignment links L and defines the alignment constraints CA so that there is a consistency between the links in the ( fj _CITE_ as the set of alignment links is generally obtained after applying a symmetrization heuristic to sourceto - target and target - to - source Viterbi alignments . In the following section we depart from this approach and apply novel functions to rank and count target - side translations according to their quality in the context of each parallel sentence , as defined by the word alignment models . We also depart from common practice in that we do not use a set of links as alignment constraints .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

A first step towards making this possible is gathering a large amount of bibliographic data , extract mentions of papers , authors , venues , and institutions , and perform massive - scale cross document entity resolution ( coreference ) and relation extraction to identify the real - world entities . To this end , we implement a prototype “ epistemological ” knowledge base for bibliographic data . Currently , we have supplemented DBLP _CITE_ with extra mentions from BibTeX files to create a database with over ten million mentions ( 6 million authors , 2 . 3 million papers , 2 . 2 million venues , and 500k institutions ).

Consequently , CUI - less facts are ignored in our evaluation framework . In this work , we will focus only on the fact types of Disorders and Procedures , and use SNOMED as our medical taxonomy . We also use Linkbase _CITE_ as our knowledge - base for descriptions of the fact codes . Some of the unique characteristics of medical fact coding compared to the traditional entity recognition are as follows : In the official data of the Semeval task , it is reported that at least a quarter of the annotated facts are CUI - less ( Pradhan et al ., 2014 ).

The aim is not to use the data to infer or prove dispersal and vicariance events for the phylogeny of the Pomatiopsidae , instead the approach is to compare patterns in the phylogeny with the two main hypotheses for the historical biogeography and evolution of these snails and to assess their relative degrees of fit .

We evaluate the advantages / drawbacks of each HIT design and show that , in our case , the use of non - expert annotations is a viable and costeffective alternative to expert annotations .

Crowdsourcing enables requesters to tap from a global pool of non - experts to obtain rapid and affordable answers to simple Human Intelligence Tasks ( HITs ), which can be subsequently used to train data - driven applications . A number of recent papers on this subject point out that non - expert annotations , if produced in a sufficient quantity , can rival and even surpass the quality of expert annotations , often at a much lower cost ( Snow et al ., 2008 ), ( Su et al ., 2007 ).__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

The use of a restricted database is expected to result in largely the same positive read classification regarding taxa that are included in the restricted reference .

Since this prior structure can be implemented using efficient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques , we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling .

There is a significant body of work applying LDA to an wide variety of tasks including analysis of news articles [ 14 ], study of the history of scientific ideas [ 2 , 9 ], topic - based search interfaces _CITE_ and navigation tools for digital libraries [ 12 ]. In practice , users of topic models are typically faced with two immediate problems : First , extremely common words tend to dominate all topics . Second , there is relatively little guidance available on how to set T , the number of topics , or studies regarding the effects of using a suboptimal setting for T . Standard practice is to remove “ stop words ” before modeling using a manually constructed , corpus - specific stop word list and to optimize T by either analyzing probabilities of held - out documents or resorting to a more complicated nonparametric model .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

In the second part of the study , the effects of the type of procedure on estimates of the functional status of patients was examined . It appears that cold deck imputation leads to significantly different estimates of the mean functional status in a group of patients than either hot deck imputation or treating the missing responses as if these items had never been offered . Differences between estimates Page 9 of 11 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2004 , 2 _CITE_ tk obtained using the latter two methods were not significant .

The left column of Fig . 2 presents a screen from the annotation process , while the right column shows how we inform annotators about their mistakes . As an alternative to human annotators , we propose an automatic method to evaluate samples , which we find to correlate well with human evaluation : We apply the Inception model _CITE_ [ 20 ] to every generated image to get the conditional label distribution p ( y | x ). Images that contain meaningful objects should have a conditional label distribution p ( y | x ) with low entropy . Moreover , we expect the model to generate varied images , so the marginal f p ( y | x = G ( z )) dz should have high entropy .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

Experiments on a large - scale real - world Twitter dataset show that Twitter - BTM outperforms several stateof - the - art baselines . In recent years , short texts are increasingly prevalent due to the explosive growth of online social media . For example , about 500 million tweets are published per day on Twitter _CITE_ , one of the most popular online social networking services . Probabilistic topic models ( Blei et al ., 2003 ) are broadly used to uncover the hidden topics of tweets , since the low - dimensional semantic representation is crucial for many applications , such as product recommendation ( Zhao et al ., 2014 ), hashtag recommendation ( Ma et al ., 2014 ), user interest tracking ( Sasaki et al ., 2014 ), sentiment analysis ( Si et al ., 2013 ). However , the scarcity of context and the noisy words restrict LDA and its variations in topic modeling over short texts .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

The “ frequent terms ”- lists for these attributes were generated using a manually verified list gathered from a general purpose dataset used for earlier experiments . A “ host ”- attribute is also used , which we binarised into a large number of binary host name attributes as most machine learning algorithms cannot cope with string attributes . For this purpose we took the 30 most common hosts in our dataset , which included Livejournal , _CITE_ Xanga , 20six , etc ., but also a number of hosts that are obviously not blog sites ( but host many pages that resemble blogs ). Negative indicators on common hosts that don ’ t serve blogs are just as valuable to the machine learner as the positive indicators of common blog hosts .

This confidently beats the “ magic barrier ” of 0 . 73 reported in the collaborative filtering literature [ 11 ]. The root mean squared error ( RMSE ) measured for the same clustering with a mean of z values within each section c , d taken for prediction yields 0 . 96 ( with a deviation below 0 . 01 ). This is much better than 1 . 165 RMSE reported for a dataset 20 times larger [ 20 ] and quite close to 0 . 9525 RMSE reported by Netflix for a dataset 1000 times larger of a similar nature _CITE_ . A new model independent approach to the analysis of data given in the form of samples of a function Z ( X , Y ) rather than samples of co - occurrence statistics of X and Y is introduced . From a theoretical viewpoint the approach is a much required extension of the Information Bottleneck method that allows for its application to entirely new domains .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

This is the main tool of experimental nonlinear dynamics [ 8 ]; but the assumption of determinism is crucial and false , for almost any interesting neural system . While classical state - space reconstruction won ’ t work on stochastic processes , such processes do have state - space representations [ 11 ], and , in the special case of discretevalued , discrete - time series , there are ways to reconstruct the state space . Here we use the CSSR algorithm , introduced in [ 12 ] ( code available at _CITE_ ). This produces causal state models , which are stochastic automata capable of statistically - optimal nonlinear prediction ; the state of the machine is a minimal sufficient statistic for the future of the observable process [ 13 ]. 1 The basic idea is to form a set of states which should be ( 1 ) Markovian , ( 2 ) sufficient statistics for the next observable , and ( 3 ) have deterministic transitions ( in the automata - theory sense ). The algorithm begins with a minimal , one - state , IID model , and checks whether these properties hold , by means of hypothesis tests .__label__Method|Code|Use

As we see , incorporating energy saturation reduces the time to convergence ( while achieving the same level of accuracy ), and using focused random walk moves further decreases the convergence time , especially as n increases . We compare FocusedFlatSAT against several state - of - the - art methods for computing an estimate of or bound on the partition function . _CITE_ An evaluation such as this is inherently challenging as the ground truth is very hard to obtain and computational bounds can be orders of magnitude off from the truth , making a comparison of estimates not very meaningful . We therefore propose to evaluate the methods on either small instances whose ground truth can be evaluated by “ brute force ,” or larger instances whose ground truth ( or bounds on it ) can be computed analytically or through other tools such as efficient model counters . We also consider planar cases for which a specialized polynomial time exact algorithm is available .__label__Method|Algorithm|Compare

Earlier work on Turkish indicates that starting with default Moses parameters and applying MERT to the resulting model does not even come close to the performance of the model with those two specific parameters set as such ( distortion limit - 1 and distortion weight 0 . 1 ), most likely because the default parameters do not encourage the range of distortions that are needed to deal with the constituent order differences . Earlier work on Turkish also shows that even when the weight - d parameter is initialized with this specific value , the space explored for distortion weight and other parameters do not produce any improvements on the test set , even though MERT claims there are improvements on the tune set . The other practical reasons for not using MERT were the following : at the time we performed this work , the discussion thread at _CITE_ indicated that MERT was not tested on multiple factors . The discussion thread at http :// www . mail - archive . com / moses - support @ mit . edu / msg00262 . html claimed that MERT does not help very much with factored models .

It is built from widely - used , freely available resources : the OpinionFinder ( Wilson et al ., 2005 ) and General Inquirer ( Stone et al ., 1966 ) lexicons and the OpinionFinder system . _CITE_ We also use a new Opinion Extraction system ( Johansson and Moschitti , 2013 ) that shows better performance than previous work on fine - grained sentiment analysis , and a new automatically developed connotation lexicon ( Feng et al ., 2013 ). We implement a weighted voting method among these various sentiment resources .

Whilst these initiatives have made good progress on written language and current coding practice , none of them have focused on the creation of standards and tools for cross - level spoken language corpus annotation . It is only recently that there has been a major effort in this domain . The project Multi - level Annotation Tools Engineering ( MATE ) ( _CITE_ ) was launched in March 1998 in response to the need for standards and tools in support of creating , annotating , evaluating and exploiting spoken language resources . The central idea of MATE has been to work on both annotation theory and practice in order to connect the two through a flexible framework which can ensure a common and user - friendly approach across annotation levels . On the tools side , this means that users are able to use level - independent tools and an interface representation which is independent of the internal coding file representation .__label__Method|Tool|Introduce

ROUGE scores , based on n - gram overlap between human abstracts and automatic extracts , were also calculated for comparison [ 5 ]. ROUGE2 , based on bigram overlap , is considered the most stable as far as correlating with human judgments , and this was therefore our ROUGE metric of interest . ROUGE - SU4 , which evaluates bigrams with intervening material between the two elements of the bigram , has recently been shown in the context of the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) _CITE_ to bring no significant additional information as compared with ROUGE - 2 .

One of the most successful approaches in the last years is the supervised learning from examples , in which statistical or Machine Learning classification models are induced from semantically annotated corpora ( M ` arquez et al ., 2006 ). Generally , supervised systems have obtained better results than the unsupervised ones , as shown by experimental work and international evaluation exercises such This paper has been supported by the European Union under the projects QALL - ME ( FP6 IST - 033860 ) and KYOTO ( FP7 ICT - 211423 ), and the Spanish Government under the project Text - Mess ( TIN2006 - 15265 - C06 - 01 ) and KNOW ( TIN2006 - 15049 - C03 - 01 ) as Senseval . These annotated corpora are usually manually tagged by lexicographers with word senses taken from a particular lexical semantic resource – most commonly WordNet _CITE_ ( WN ) ( Fellbaum , 1998 ). WN has been widely criticized for being a sense repository that often provides too fine – grained sense distinctions for higher level applications like Machine Translation or Question & Answering . In fact , WSD at this level of granularity has resisted all attempts of inferring robust broadcoverage models .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Unstructured Information Management Architecture ( UIMA ) ( Ferrucci and Lally , 2004 ) is a framework that supports the interoperability of mediaprocessing software components by defining common data structures and interfaces the components exchange and implement .

Notable examples include METANET4U components ( Thompson et al ., 2011 ) featured in U - Compare _CITE_ , DKPro ( Gurevych et al ., 2007 ), cTAKES ( Savova et al ., 2010 ), BioNLP - UIMA Component Repository ( Baumgartner et al ., 2008 ), and JULIE Lab ’ s UIMA Component Repository ( JCoRe ) ( Hahn et al ., 2008 ). However , despite conforming to the UIMA standard , each repository of analytics usually comes with its own set of type systems , i . e ., representations of data models that are meant to be shared between analytics and thus ensuring their interoperability . At present , UIMA does not facilitate the alignment of ( all or selected ) types between type systems , which makes it impossible to combine analytics coming from different repositories without an additional programming effort .__label__Method|Algorithm|Compare

SVD + SMM is a two - step procedure : 1 ) extracting low - dimensional representations of words by using a singular value decomposition ( SVD ), and 2 ) learning a support measure machine using the distribution of extracted representations of words appearing in each document with the same kernels as the latent SMM . word2vec + SMM employs the representations of words learnt by word2vec [ 7 ] and uses them for the SMM as in SVD + SMM . Here we use pre - trained 300 dimensional word representation vectors from the Google News corpus , which can be downloaded from the author ’ s website _CITE_ . Note that word2vec + SMM utilizes an additional resource to represent the latent vectors for words unlike the latent SMM , and the learning of word2vec requires n - gram information about documents , which is lost in the BoW representation .

We sampled between 10 and 1000 training triples from the other half ( Figure 4 ). Distributional semantic models ( Turney and Pantel , 2010 ) encode word meaning in a vector format by counting co - occurrences with other words within a specified context window . We constructed the vectors from the October 2013 dump of Wikipedia articles , which was tokenised using the Stanford NLP tools _CITE_ , lemmatised with the Morpha lemmatiser ( Minnen et al ., 2001 ), and parsed with the C & C parser ( Clark and Curran , 2007 ). In this paper we use sentence boundaries to define context windows and the top 10 , 000 most frequent lemmatised words in the whole corpus ( excluding stopwords ) as context words . The raw co - occurrence counts are re - weighted using the standard tTest weighting scheme ( Curran , 2004 ), where fwicj is the number of times target noun wi occurs with context word cj : and p (, cj ) Ek El fwkcl .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Data weighting approaches ( Matsoukas et al ., 2009 ; Foster et al ., 2010 ; Huang and Xiang , 2010 ; Phillips and Brown , 2011 ; Sennrich , 2012 ) use a rich feature set to decide on weights for the training data , at the sentence or phrase pair level . For instance , a sentence from a corpus whose domain is far from that of the dev set would typically receive a low weight , but sentences in this corpus that appear to be of a general nature might receive higher weights . The 2012 JHU workshop on Domain Adaptation for MT _CITE_ proposed phrase sense disambiguation ( PSD ) for translation model adaptation .

As we attempt to address the modern biodiversity crisis , assessing the conservation status of species has become an invaluable tool for biodiversity conservation . Evaluating threat based on the Red List Categories and Criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN , 2012 ) is an authoritative , comprehensive and widely used approach in conservation biology ( Rodrigues , Pilgrim , Lamoreux , Hoffmann , & Brooks , 2006 ). Indeed , many decisions made by governments , natural resource managers , and conservation planners ( Rodrigues et al ., 2006 ) rely ( often solely ) on the “ Red List ” published by IUCN ( _CITE_ ). For example , programs such as Important Bird Areas ( IBA ), Important Plant Areas ( IPA , Anderson , 2002 ) or Tropical Important Plant Areas ( TIPA , Darbyshire et al ., 2017 ) all rely directly on threat assessments based on IUCN criteria . In parallel , there is also an urgency in listing threatened species in the near future .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

As for spoken language , Caines & Buttery ( 2010 ) among others suggest that adaptation can also be made to the parser , such that it enters a ‘ speech - aware mode ’ in which the parser refers to additional and / or replacement rules adapted to the particular features of spoken language . They demonstrated this with the omission of auxiliary verbs in progressive aspect sentences (‘ you talking to me ?’, ’ how you doing ?’) and achieved a 30 % improvement in parsing success rate for this construction type . Our speech data consist of recordings from Business Language Testing Service ( BULATS ) speaking tests _CITE_ . In the test , learners are required to undertake five tasks ; we exclude the tasks involving brief question - answering (‘ can you tell me your full name ?’, ‘ where are you from ?’, etc ) and elicited imitation , leaving us with three free - form speech tasks .

Three distinct human summaries were produced for each chain . For each chain , one summary was produced for each of the three queries , where the person producing the summary was not shown the next steps in the chain when answering the first query . To simulate the exploratory search of the user we provided the annotators with a Solr _CITE_ query interface for each document collection .

In this study , we aim to construct such a system and to demonstrate that it outperforms strict string matching approaches . We refer to our system as SimSem , as in “ Similarity ” and “ Semantic ”. SimString _CITE_ is a software library utilising the CPMerge algorithm ( Okazaki and Tsujii , 2010 ) to enable fast approximate string matching . The software makes it possible to find matches in a collection with over ten million entries using cosine similarity and a similarity threshold of 0 . 7 in approximately 1 millisecond with modest modern hardware . This makes it useful for querying a large collection of strings to find entries which may differ from the query string only superficially and may still be members of the same semantic category .__label__Method|Code|Produce

In each run , the true mixing matrix was given by inverting W randomly generated from standard Gaussian and then row - normalized to have unit norms . The three methods were : 1 ) FastICA _CITE_ with the tanh nonlinearity , 2 ) Our method ( symmetric model ) without energy - dependence ( NoDep ) initialized by FastICA , and 3 ) Our full method ( symmetric model ) initialized by NoDep . NoDep was the same as the full method except that the off - diagonal elements of H was kept zero .

The complete set of rules can be found in ( Hwa et al ., 2002 ). Because our error analysis and subsequent algorithm refinements made use of our original Chinese - English data set , we created a new test set based on 88 new Chinese sentences from the Penn Chinese Treebank , already manually translated into English as part of the NIST MT evaluation preview . _CITE_ These sentences averaged 19 . 0 words in length . As described above , parses ort the English side were created semi - automatically , and word alignments were acquired manually . However , in order to reduce our reliance ort linguistically sophisticated human annotators for Chinese syntax , we adopted art alternative strategy for obtaining the gold standard : we automatically converted the Treebank & apos ; s constituency parses of the Chinese sentences into syntactic dependency representations , using art algorithm similar to the one described in Section 2 of the paper by Xia and Palmer ( 2001 ).__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce
The first step involves extraction of semantic and temporal features for the annotated medical concepts , as described in Section 4 from both corpora . The semantic relatedness scores are computed using the kDLS ( Xiang et al ., 2011 ) method to calculate the relationship between concepts in the UMLS with value of - y set to 7 . The type of relation between medical concepts is derived by matching word stems in each medical concept using the Lucene _CITE_ implementation of the Porter stemming algorithm . We query the latest release ( UMLS 2011AB ) of the UMLS Metathesaurus for finding a match between medical concept and the UMLS definition or UMLS atoms .

Graphs have long been used to describe linguistic annotations , most familiarly in the form of trees ( a graph in which each node has a single parent ) for syntactic annotation . Annotation Graphs ( Bird and Liberman , 2001 ) have been widely used to represent layers of annotation , each associated with primary data , although the concept was not extended to allow for annotations linked to other annotations and thus to consider multiple annotations as a single graph . More recently , the Penn Discourse TreeBank released its annotations of the Penn TreeBank as a graph , accompanied by an API that provides a set of standard graphhandling functions for query and access _CITE_ .

Evaluating threat based on the Red List Categories and Criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN , 2012 ) is an authoritative , comprehensive and widely used approach in conservation biology ( Rodrigues , Pilgrim , Lamoreux , Hoffmann , & Brooks , 2006 ). Indeed , many decisions made by governments , natural resource managers , and conservation planners ( Rodrigues et al ., 2006 ) rely ( often solely ) on the “ Red List ” published by IUCN ( _CITE_ ). For example , programs such as Important Bird Areas ( IBA ), Important Plant Areas ( IPA , Anderson , 2002 ) or Tropical Important Plant Areas ( TIPA , Darbyshire et al ., 2017 ) all rely directly on threat assessments based on IUCN criteria . In parallel , there is also an urgency in listing threatened species in the near future .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce
Two exceptions are consortia that have their own data repository or portal ( like CPTAC ) and organism - specific resources such as the ‘ Saccharomyces Genome database ’. This is because the first substantial obstacle for integrative data scientists is finding suitable data sets to link . This key issue is being addressed by the Omics Discovery Index ( OmicsDI ) ( _CITE_ ), a recently released portal for the discovery and access of data sets from various omics approaches and online resources [ 48 ]. Among other features , OmicsDI represents the concept of multiomics data sets by connecting different omics datasets cited in the same publication . For instance , in September 2016 OmicsDI knew about more than 30 multiomics data sets that contain both proteomics data and the corresponding gene expression data .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

The DC elements ‘ dc : coverage ’ and ‘ dc : subject ’ have a high topical overlap ( _CITE_ ); for instance , subject elements often contain location names such as countries . The usage of the ‘ coverage ’ element – intended to denote spatial and temporal applicability – is very diverse and ranges from standardized dates with milliseconds granularity to relative - time indications such as ‘ Early Middle Ages ’, and can contain both instants and time ranges . We addressed this semantic problem by introducing a set of experimental , non - validated fields whose content is the result of a named entity recognition and geocoding .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

The results show that the first and second CDBN representations both outperform baseline features ( RAW and MFCC ). The numbers compare MFCC and CDBN features with as many of the same factors ( such as preprocessing and classification algorithms ) as possible .

Our results suggest that without special preprocessing or postprocess ing ( besides the summary statistics which were needed to reduce the number of features ), the CDBN features outperform MFCC features , especially in a setting with a very limited number of labeled examples . We further experimented to determine if the CDBN features can achieve competitive performance in comparison to other more sophisticated , state - of - the - art methods .__label__Method|Code|Use

Different approaches have been proposed to evaluate the performance of automatic alignment systems and the output they produce . These include the manual analysis of correspondences in the alignment [ 7 ], comparing the alignment against a reference alignment [ 4 , 5 ], measuring the extent to which the alignment preserves the structural properties of the input ontologies [ 18 ], checking the coherence of the alignment with respect to the input ontologies [ 19 ], and evaluating the alignment within an application ( end - to - end evaluation ) [ 20 ], while the comparison against ( preferably manually created ) reference alignments is by far the most common evaluation approach that has been used in international evaluation campaigns for many years now [ 21 ]. However , although the manual creation of ontology alignments is known to be time consuming and expensive , and in the same time inherently error - prone ( Euzenat even states that “ humans are not usually very good at Beisswanger and Hahn Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2012 , 3 ( Suppl 1 ): S4 Page 13 of 14 _CITE_ matching ontologies manually ”, p . 202 in [ 1 ]), not much work has been published on quality assurance of existing manual alignments , yet . This particularly concerns technical aspects , which strongly affect the reusability of alignments ( target of our Checks 1 to 5 ). Regarding validity aspects ( target of our Checks 6 to 10 ), some of the evaluation approaches proposed for the analysis of automatically created alignments could be adopted , such as the structural [ 18 ] or alignment coherence analysis [ 19 ].__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

Moreover , rotational invariance has been sought : ( i ) many data augmentation schemes have used rotated versions of images and ( ii ) models have been developed to learn this invariance , like the Spatial Transformer Networks [ 14 ].

ROUGE scores , based on n - gram overlap between human abstracts and automatic extracts , were also calculated for comparison [ 5 ]. ROUGE2 , based on bigram overlap , is considered the most stable as far as correlating with human judgments , and this was therefore our ROUGE metric of interest . ROUGE - SU4 , which evaluates bigrams with intervening material between the two elements of the bigram , has recently been shown in the context of the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) _CITE_ to bring no significant additional information as compared with ROUGE - 2 . Results from [ 4 ] and from DUC 2005 also show that ROUGE does not always correlate well with human judgments .

SemCor The SENSEVAL - 2 English tasks have decided to use the WordNet 1 . 7 sense inventory , and therefore we had to deal with the task of mapping SemCor senses , which were assigned using an earlier version of WordNet , to the corresponding senses in WordNet 1 . 7 . When a word sense from WordNet 1 . 6 is missing we assign a default sense of 0 . _CITE_ WordNet The main idea in generating a sense tagged corpus out of WordNet is very simple . It is based on the underlying assumption that each example pertains to a word belonging to the current synset , thereby allowing us to assign the correct sense to at least one word in each example .

Finally , the corpus is applied in several tasks , such as generation of emotion object ontology or retrieval of emotional and moral consequences of actions . There is a lack of large corpora for Japanese applicable in sentiment and affect analysis . Although there are large corpora of newspaper articles , like Mainichi Shinbun Corpus , or corpora of classic literature , like Aozora Bunko _CITE_ , they are usually unsuitable for research on emotions since spontaneous emotive expressions either appear rarely in these kinds of texts ( newspapers ), or the vocabulary is not up to date ( classic literature ). Although there exist speech corpora , such as Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese , which could become suitable for this kind of research , due to the difficulties with compilation of such corpora they are relatively small .

Sen . Shelby ( D - AL ) votes with the Republicans on Economic , with the Democrats on Education + Domestic and with a small group of maverick Republicans on Foreign and Social Security + Medicare . Sen . Shelby , together with Sen . Heflin , is a Democrat from a fairly conservative state ( Alabama ) and are found to side with the Republicans on many issues . The second dataset involves the voting record of the UN General Assembly _CITE_ . We focus on the resolutions discussed from 1990 - 2003 , which contain votes of 192 countries on 931 resolutions . If a country is present during the roll call , it may choose to vote Yes , No or the corresponding groups for each topic ( column ).__label__Material|Data|Introduce
SVD + SMM is a two - step procedure : 1 ) extracting low - dimensional representations of words by using a singular value decomposition ( SVD ), and 2 ) learning a support measure machine using the distribution of extracted representations of words appearing in each document with the same kernels as the latent SMM . word2vec + SMM employs the representations of words learnt by word2vec [ 7 ] and uses them for the SMM as in SVD + SMM . Here we use pre - trained 300 dimensional word representation vectors from the Google News corpus , which can be downloaded from the author ’ s website _CITE_ . Note that word2vec + SMM utilizes an additional resource to represent the latent vectors for words unlike the latent SMM , and the learning of word2vec requires n - gram information about documents , which is lost in the BoW representation . With SVMs , we use a Gaussian RBF kernel with parameter y and a quadratic polynomial kernel , and the features are represented as BoW .__label__Supplement|Website|Use
Annotations of lncRNAs and protein - coding genes were obtained from GENCODE v24 ( _CITE_ ), and only the longest transcript was selected for each gene with several transcripts . As the TE annotations , we used the mapping result of Repeat Library 20140131 to hg38 , which is published by RepeatMasker [ 20 ], after excluding simple repeats , low - complexity , non - coding RNA , and satellites . Overlaps between lncRNAs and TEs were detected using our own Perl script .__label__Material|Data|Use
For our algorithms , we swept values of a in { 2 − 1 , 2 − 2 , ..., 2 − 10 } from largest to smallest and chose the solution that produced the least number of stars . Furthermore , we warm - started the symmetric algorithm with the star - pattern solution of the asymmetric algorithm to make it converge more quickly . We first explored six standard data - sets from UCI _CITE_ in the uniform anonymity setting . Figure 3 ( a ) summarizes the results where utility is plotted against 6 . Fewer stars imply greater utility and larger 6 implies higher anonymity .__label__Material|Data|Use
The parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood on the training set ; we also implemented a simple absolute discounting smoothing method ( Zhai and Lafferty , 2001 ) that improves the results for both tasks . Table 2 shows the results ( F - measures ) for the problem of finding the most likely sequence of roles given the features observed . In this case , the relation is hidden and we marginalize over it _CITE_ . We experimented with different values for the smoothing factor ranging from a minimum of 0 . 0000005 to a maximum of 10 ; the results shown fix the smoothing factor at its minimum value . We found that for the dynamic models , for a wide range of smoothing factors , we achieved almost identical results ; nevertheless , in future work , we plan to implement cross - validation to find the optimal smoothing factor .__label__Method|Code|Produce
In experiments that include multiple QC types , mixnorm will estimate the mean difference in metabolite levels for different types of QCs . If different QC pools are reflective of different types of analytical samples of interest , these location shifts can be applied to analytical data if desired .

Modular Program Constructor ( MPC ): MPC focuses on using easily understood directives to extract generically coded JSim MML equations from files , changing the names of the generic variables to ontologically informative names and assembling the resulting code into new equations ( Raymond & Bassingthwaighte , 2011 ). For example , MPC can take MML code representing a single tissue exchange region ( 26 lines ), and generate a whole organ heterogeneous model for convection , diffusion , and reaction with 20 regions ( 1698 lines ). See _CITE_ MPC currently runs outside of JSim but is planned for incorporation into a future JSim release . Modular construction with SemSim : Precise semantic identification of variables and parameters is a prerequisite to merging of preconstructed submodels or modules into integrated systems or multiscale models .__label__Method|Tool|Use

As for spoken language , Caines & Buttery ( 2010 ) among others suggest that adaptation can also be made to the parser , such that it enters a ‘ speech - aware mode ’ in which the parser refers to additional and / or replacement rules adapted to the particular features of spoken language . They demonstrated this with the omission of auxiliary verbs in progressive aspect sentences (‘ you talking to me ?’, ’ how you doing ?’) and achieved a 30 % improvement in parsing success rate for this construction type . Our speech data consist of recordings from Business Language Testing Service ( BULATS ) speaking tests _CITE_ . In the test , learners are required to undertake five tasks ; we exclude the tasks involving brief question - answering (‘ can you tell me your full name ?’, ‘ where are you from ?’, etc ) and elicited imitation , leaving us with three free - form speech tasks . For this particular test the tasks were : [ a ] talk about some advice from a colleague ( monologue ), [ b ] talk about a series of charts from Business Today magazine ( monologue ), [ c ] give advice on starting a new retail business ( dialogue with examiner ).__label__Supplement|Website|Use

With smaller amounts , however , this isn ' t always possible , and when it is possible , it can produce worse actual running times than a disk - based approach . As our goal is to judge streaming algorithms under low memory conditions , we used the first approach , which is more fitting to such a constraint . Each algorithm _CITE_ was programmed in C / C ++, compiled with g ++, and run under Ubuntu Linux ( 10 . 04 LTS ) on HP Pavilion p6520f Desktop PC , with an AMD Athlon II X4 635 Processor running at 2 . 9 GhZ and with 6 GB main memory ( although nowhere near the entirety of this was used by any algorithm ). For StreamKM ++, the authors ' implementation [ 2 ], also in C , was used instead . With all algorithms , the reported cost is determined by taking the resulting k facilities and computing the k - means cost across the entire dataset .__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce
The method was implemented on GPflow [ 20 ] and compared against GPflow ’ s version of the following baselines : exact GP ( GP ), sparse GP using the collapsed bound ( SGP ), and stochastic variational inference using the uncollapsed bound ( SVI ).

In this case , convergence with probability one ( w . p . 1 ) to a local optimum can be established for arbitrary differentiable policy classes under mild assumptions [ 22 , 13 , 19 ]. On the other hand , while the greedy value function approach is often considered to possess practical advantages in terms of convergence speed and representational flexibility , its behavior in the proximity of an optimum is currently not well understood . It is well known that interactively operated approximate hard - greedy An extended version of this paper with full proofs and additional background material is available at _CITE_ and http :// users . ics . aalto . fi / pwagner /. value function methods can fail to converge to any single policy and instead become trapped in sustained policy oscillation or policy chattering , which is currently a poorly understood phenomenon [ 6 , 7 ].

Lexique Pro , an excellent free tool by SIL International ( http :// www . lexiquepro . com /) is smaller , but there are differences in that Lexique Pro is a Windows - only closed - source program whose native MDF ( Multi - Dictionary - Formatter ) format is not as flexible as XML and therefore cannot be processed by the many tools that handle XML and TEI in particular . Consequently , the perspectives for re - use of Lexique Pro dictionaries in computational linguistic applications are much smaller . To our knowledge , Lexique Pro does not make it possible for users to query words straight off web pages , which can be done thanks to dict , a Firefox add - on ( _CITE_ ). It admittedly has other advantages that make it a serious alternative . 7 The ideal solution would be to have an editing front - end such as Lexique Pro coupled with the openness and modifiability of the data offered by FreeDict . Indeed , there are plans for creating a converter from the new LIFT interchange standard ( http :// code . google . com / p / lift - standard /) that the beta versions of Lexique Pro can read 7 We do not discuss professional commercial dictionary writing systems such as TshwaneLex ( http :// tshwanedje . com / tshwanelex /) because , despite the academic discounts , they may be out of range for the average developer .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Reliable inference from the observed number of spikes about the underlying firing rate of a neuronal response , however , requires a sufficiently long time interval , while integration times of neurons in vivo [ 3 ] as well as reaction times of humans or animals when performing classification tasks [ 4 , 5 ] are known to be rather short . Therefore , it is important to understand , how neural rate coding is affected by a limited time window available for decoding . While rate codes are usually characterized by tuning functions relating the intensity of the * _CITE_ neuronal response to a particular stimulus parameter , the question , how relevant the idea of analog coding actually is does not depend on the particular entity represented by a neuron . Instead it suffices to determine the shape of the gain function , which displays the mean firing rate as a function of the actual analog signal to be sent to subsequent neurons . Here we seek for optimal gain functions that minimize the minimum average squared reconstruction error for a uniform source signal transmitted through a Poisson channel as a function of the maximum mean number of spikes .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

The translation quality of state - of - the - art , phrase - based statistical machine translation ( SMT ) approaches heavily depends on the amount of bilingual language resources available to train the statistical models .

There exist several data collection initiatives like the Linguistic Data Consortium , the European Language Resource Association _CITE_ , or the GSK , amassing and distributing large amounts of textual data . However , for less frequently used language pairs , e . g ., most of the Asian languages , only a limited amount of bilingual resources are available , if at all . In order to overcome such language resource limitations , recent research on multilingual SMT focuses on the usage of pivot languages .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce
Especially when using bag - ofwords term weighting , such as in our evaluation , information on what is not relevant to the query only introduces noise .

Three assumptions or alternative input data are the most influential on the relative and absolute outcome of the health impact assessment : the sources of relative risks used in the blood pressure to health association , the dose - response between salt intake and blood pressure and the distribution of risk factors . Because of the importance of the effect of the relative risk on the outcome , it is important that the source is obtained from good quality , prospective studies . This study showed that using PLOS ONE | _CITE_ November28 , 2017 10 / 14 Identification of differences in health impact modelling of salt reduction categorical risk factor distributions seemed to reduce the sensitivity of the model to changes in salt intake . This is probably due to the fact that this modelling approach lowers blood pressure in all subjects lowering salt intake will decrease blood pressure in all subjects , but only a few subjects will shift to a lower blood pressure category and thereby will have a lower risk of developing CVD . In general , uncertainty analyses show how the health impact estimate depends on the underlying assumptions and ( demographic ) input data within a single HIA model and is therefore helpful to identify the range of the expected effect .__label__Supplement|Paper|Use

The translation quality of state - of - the - art , phrase - based statistical machine translation ( SMT ) approaches heavily depends on the amount of bilingual language resources available to train the statistical models . For frequently used language pairs like French - English or ChineseEnglish , large - sized text data sets are readily available . There exist several data collection initiatives like the Linguistic Data Consortium , the European Language Resource Association _CITE_ , or the GSK , amassing and distributing large amounts of textual data . However , for less frequently used language pairs , e . g ., most of the Asian languages , only a limited amount of bilingual resources are available , if at all . In order to overcome such language resource limitations , recent research on multilingual SMT focuses on the usage of pivot languages .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

For all approaches , the associated cost function was maximized together with an added regularization penalty term , − 2A || w || , which ensures that the global maximum of the cost function is achieved for finite w .

They will be able to relate lower - granularity molecular functions in relation to highergranularity biological processes , and establish other sorts of relations between entities in different parts of GO .__label__Material|Data|Use
The second , Cluster - Based LML ( CBLML ), is also a variant of PLML without weight learning . Here we learn one local metric for each cluster and we assign a weight of one for a basis metric Mbi if the corresponding cluster of Mbi contains the instance , and zero otherwise . Finally , we also compare against four state of the art metric learning methods LMNN [ 15 ], BoostMetric [ 13 ] , GLML [ 11 ] and LMNN - MM [ 15 ] _CITE_ . The former two learn a single global metric and the latter two a number of local metrics . In addition to the different metric learning methods , we also compare PLML against multi - class SVMs in which we use the one - against - all strategy to determine the class label for multi - class problems and select the best kernel with inner cross validation .__label__Method|Algorithm|Compare
In particular , we will show an initial version of a GUI - based top - level for the development environment , a tool that supports graphical debugging of unification grammars by cutting and pasting of derivation trees , and various functionalities that support systematic development of speech translation and spoken dialogue applications built using Regulus . The Regulus platform is a comprehensive toolkit for developing grammar - based speech - enabled systems that can be run on the commercially available Nuance recognition environment . The platform has been developed by an Open Source consortium , the main partners of which have been NASA Ames Research Center and Geneva University , and is freely available for download from the SourceForge website _CITE_ . Regulus has been used to build several large systems , including Geneva University ’ s MedSLT medical speech translator ( Bouillon et al ., 2005 ) and NASA ’ s Clarissa procedure browser ( Rayner et al ., 2005b ) .

OCP provides Web - services for individual tile requests that extract image planes from volume databases . To accelerate visualization when accessing nearby slices or when viewing data repeatedly , OCP manages a hierarchy of caches . First , an in - memory tile cache is maintained in the OCP data cluster using memcached ( _CITE_ ). The cache contains the most frequently accessed tiles , subject to the cluster ’ s memory capacity .

Moreover , our previous study revealed that pterygium appears to be more prevalent among people with a low sociodemographic status [ 8 ]. In the present study , we confirmed that increasing age and living in a relatively rural area were associated with an increased risk of pterygium . Furthermore , income level was not associated with pterygium in the present study , and this result is also consistent with the findings of our previous cross - sectional study PLOS ONE | _CITE_ March 27 , 2017 7 / 10 Epidemiology of pterygium in South Korea [ 8 ]. However , we observed conflicting results regarding the association of pterygium and sex , as female sex was associated with this disease in the present study ( vs . male sex in our previous study ). This discrepancy might be caused by a higher detection rate among female South Koreans , as they are more likely to be concerned regarding cosmetic problems , compared to their male counterparts .__label__Supplement|Paper|Extent

A lot of work has gone into developing powerful optimization methods for solving these combinatorial problems . In contrast , we explore , analyze , and demonstrate that a substantially simpler randomized greedy inference algorithm already suffices for near optimal parsing : a ) we analytically quantify the number of local optima that the greedy method has to overcome in the context of first - order parsing ; b ) we show that , as a decoding algorithm , the greedy method surpasses dual decomposition in second - order parsing ; c ) we empirically demonstrate that our approach with up to third - order and global features outperforms the state - of - the - art dual decomposition and MCMC sampling methods when evaluated on 14 languages of non - projective CoNLL datasets . _CITE_ Dependency parsing is typically guided by parameterized scoring functions that involve rich features exerting refined control over the choice of parse trees . As a consequence , finding the highest scoring parse tree is a provably hard combinatorial inference problem ( McDonald and Pereira , 2006 ). Much of the recent work on parsing has focused on solving these problems using powerful optimization techniques .__label__Material|Data|Use

The baseline algorithms we considered include Gibbs sampling ( Gibbs - LDA ) [ 17 ], logistic / linear regression on bag - of - words , supervised - LDA ( sLDA ) [ 4 ], and MedLDA [ 26 ], which are implemented either in C ++ or Java . And our proposed algorithms are implemented in C #. _CITE_ For BP - LDA and Gibbs - LDA , we first train the models in an unsupervised manner , and then generate per - document topic proportion Bd as their features in the inference steps , on top of which we train a linear ( logistic ) regression model on the regression ( classification ) tasks . We first evaluate the prediction performance of our models and compare them with the traditional ( supervised ) topic models . Since the training of the baseline topic models takes much longer time than BP - sLDA and BP - LDA ( see Figure 5 ), we compare their performance on two smaller datasets , namely a subset ( 79K documents ) of AMR ( randomly sampled from the 7 . 9 million reviews ) and the MultiSent dataset ( 342K documents ), which are all evaluated with 5 - fold cross validation .__label__Method|Code|Produce
Through evolution , structure is more conserved than sequence , so that detecting even very subtle sequence similarities , or remote homology , is important for predicting function . The major methods for homology detection can be split into three basic groups : pairwise sequence comparison algorithms [ 1 , 2 ], generative models for protein families [ 3 , 4 ], and discriminative classifiers [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Popular sequence comparison methods such as BLAST * Supplemental information for the paper , including the data sets and Matlab source code can be found on this author ’ s web page at _CITE_ and Smith - Waterman are based on unsupervised alignment scores . Generative models such as profile hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) model positive examples of a protein family , but they can be trained iteratively using both positively labeled and unlabeled examples by pulling in close homologs and adding them to the positive set . A compromise between these methods is PSI - BLAST [ 8 ], which uses BLAST to iteratively build a probabilistic profile of a query sequence and obtain a more sensitive sequence comparison score .__label__Supplement|Document|Produce

ROUGE scores , based on n - gram overlap between human abstracts and automatic extracts , were also calculated for comparison [ 5 ]. ROUGE2 , based on bigram overlap , is considered the most stable as far as correlating with human judgments , and this was therefore our ROUGE metric of interest . ROUGE - SU4 , which evaluates bigrams with intervening material between the two elements of the bigram , has recently been shown in the context of the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) _CITE_ to bring no significant additional information as compared with ROUGE - 2 . Results from [ 4 ] and from DUC 2005 also show that ROUGE does not always correlate well with human judgments . It is therefore included in this research in the hope of further determining how reliable the ROUGE metric is for our domain of meeting summarization .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

To maintain data utility , we must balance the number of iterations and the privacy budget spent on each iteration in the training process . To use the Newton - Raphson algorithm , we need to compute the gradient and the Hessian matrix from the Ji et al . BMC Medical Genomics 2014 , 7 ( Suppl 1 ): S14 Page 4 of 10 _CITE_ data sets . The simplest way to ensure differential privacy is to add Laplacian noise to the gradient and the Hessian matrix , and use the noisy version of these intermediary results to update parameters . Theoretically , the impacts of additive noise in Laplacian mechanism ( see Definition 4 ) tend to be much smaller when the number of samples approaches infinity , as the sensitivity of the gradient and the Hessian matrix is irrelevant to the size of a data set .__label__Supplement|Paper|Extent

Unlike star trees and K & W ’ s profile model , which can only explain sequence similarity , the common ancestry models can also explain nested hierarchical sequence correlations . Hierarchical structure in a set of sequences is a direct prediction of genealogical models , in which branching of lineages occurs . For the real , universal protein data set , this hierarchical structure is the overriding factor for the superiority of the UCA Theobald Biology Direct 2011 , 6 : 60 Page 15 of 25 _CITE_ hypothesis over competing hypotheses , including various independent ancestry models . Moreover , the models used in the tests do not assume a priori that significant sequence similarity implies homology . Rather , sequence similarity is a consequence of the common ancestry models , and the common ancestry models simply explain the data best .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

In this paper we model this sub - structure and share parameters among related dependency paths , using a unified loss function learning entity and relation representations to maximize performance on the knowledge base link prediction task . We evaluate our approach on the FB15k - 237 dataset , a knowledge base derived from the Free base subset FB15k ( Bordes et al ., 2013 ) and filtered to remove highly redundant relations ( Toutanova and Chen , 2015 ). The knowledge base is paired with textual mentions for all entity pairs derived from ClueWeb12 _CITE_ with Freebase entity mention annotations ( Gabrilovich et al ., 2013 ). We show that using a convolutional neural network to derive continuous representations for textual relations boosts the overall performance on link prediction , with larger improvement on entity pairs that have textual mentions . There has been a growing body of work on learning to predict relations between entities without requiring sentence - level annotations of textual mentions at training time .__label__Material|Data|Extent

This often involves user interaction to support the system ’ s interpretation , as in ( Damljanovic et al ., 2010b ). A crucial question is to figure out whether open domain QA techniques , which leverage statistical methods and require minimal ( if any ) intervention at design stage , can be successfully combined with semantic search techniques , in order to leverage the benefits of both .

A human evaluation over 202 dialogue acts does not show any difference in naturalness and informativeness between BAGEL ’ s outputs and human utterances . Additionally , we find that the data collection process can be optimised using active learning , resulting in a significant increase in performance when training data is limited , according to ratings from 18 human judges . _CITE_ These results suggest that the proposed framework can largely reduce the development time of NLG systems . While this paper only evaluates the most likely realisation given a dialogue act , we believe that BAGEL ’ s probabilistic nature and generalisation capabilities are well suited to model the linguistic variation resulting from the diversity of annotators . Our first objective is thus to evaluate the quality of BAGEL ’ s n - best outputs , and test whether sampling from the output distribution can improve naturalness and user satisfaction within a dialogue .__label__Material|Data|Use

While such pragmatic choices may lead to * _CITE_ simple statistical measures , they do so at the cost of modeling capacity .

Through evolution , structure is more conserved than sequence , so that detecting even very subtle sequence similarities , or remote homology , is important for predicting function . The major methods for homology detection can be split into three basic groups : pairwise sequence comparison algorithms [ 1 , 2 ], generative models for protein families [ 3 , 4 ], and discriminative classifiers [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Popular sequence comparison methods such as BLAST * Supplemental information for the paper , including the data sets and Matlab source code can be found on this author ’ s web page at _CITE_ and Smith - Waterman are based on unsupervised alignment scores . Generative models such as profile hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) model positive examples of a protein family , but they can be trained iteratively using both positively labeled and unlabeled examples by pulling in close homologs and adding them to the positive set . A compromise between these methods is PSI - BLAST [ 8 ], which uses BLAST to iteratively build a probabilistic profile of a query sequence and obtain a more sensitive sequence comparison score .__label__Material|Data|Produce

Nevertheless , most of the work has focused on the task of factoid QA , where questions match short answers , usually in the form of named or numerical entities . Thanks to international evaluations organized by conferences such as the Text REtrieval Conference ( TREC ) and the Cross Language Evaluation Forum ( CLEF ) Workshop , annotated corpora of questions and answers have become available for several languages , which has facilitated the development of robust machine learning models for the task . _CITE_ The situation is different once one moves beyond the task of factoid QA . Comparatively little research has focused on QA models for non - factoid questions such as causation , manner , or reason questions . Because virtually no training data is available for this problem , most automated systems train either on small hand - annotated corpora built in - house ( Higashinaka and Isozaki 2008 ) or on question – answer pairs harvested from Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) lists or similar resources ( Soricut and Brill 2006 ; Riezler et al .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

As O (| G |) supernodes need to be updated in each iteration of Algorithm 1 , this step ( which is the most expensive step in Algorithm 1 ) takes O (| G |· N log N ) time . The total time for Algorithm 1 is O ( k · | G |· N log N ). In this section , experiments are performed on a number of benchmark multilabel data sets _CITE_ , with both tree - and DAG - structured label hierarchies ( Table 1 ). As pre - processing , we remove examples that contain partial label paths and nodes with fewer than 10 positive examples . At each parent node , we then train a multitask lasso model with logistic loss using the MALSAR package [ 22 ].__label__Material|Data|Use

This measurement shows a slight loss of accuracy without statistical significance . Finally the cross - training algorithm was applied to real data sets from both the ANU repository _CITE_ and from the the UCI repository . Experimental results were quite disappointing until we realized that the discarding steps tends to produce training sets with very different numbers of examples for each class .

It should be clear that we have left several important questions open . Perhaps the most obvious such question concerns the use of non - information theoretic objective functions . It turns out that many of our results apply with only modest changes if the experiment is instead designed to minimize something like the Bayes mean - square error ( perhaps defined only locally if O has a nontrivial manifold structure ), for example : in this case , the results in sections 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 remain completely unchanged , while the statement of our main theorem requires only slight changes in the asymptotic variance formula ( see _CITE_ ).

The main difficulty encountered related to the distinction required between proper and common nouns , the morphological boundary between the two being unclear in those fields where common nouns are often reclassified as “ proper nouns ”, as is demonstrated by the presence of these names ( Tanabe et al ., 2005 ) notes that “ a more detailed definition of a gene / protein name , as well as additional annotation rules , could improve inter - annotator agreement and help solve some of the tagging inconsistencies ”. in nomenclatures ( small , acid - soluble spore protein A is an extreme case ) or acronymisation phenomena ( one finds for example across the outer membrane ( OM )). In those cases , annotators were instructed to refer to official lists , such as SwissProt _CITE_ , which requires a significant amount of time . Delimiting the boundaries of the elements to be annotated also raised many questions . One can thus choose to annotate nifh messenger RNA if it is considered that the mention of the state messenger RNA is part of the determination of the reference , or only nifh , if it is considered that the proper noun is enough to build the determination .__label__Supplement|Document|Use

An efficient C - code implementation for Matlab of the proposed table completion tool is also released on the authors website . In recent years , probabilistic modeling has become an attractive option for building database management systems since it allows estimating missing values , detecting errors , visualizing the data , and providing probabilistic answers to queries [ 19 ]. BayesDB , _CITE_ for instance , is a database management system that resorts to Crosscat [ 18 ], which originally appeared as a Bayesian approach to model human categorization of objects . BayesDB provides missing data estimates and probabilistic answer to queries , but it only considers Gaussian and multinomial likelihood functions .

In our implementation of the BCD method , we alternate between computing the proximity operator with respect to the rows and to the columns . Since the BCD method allows us to compute a duality gap when solving the proximal problem , we can run the method until the duality gap is below a given error threshold εk to find an xk + 1 satisfying ( 4 ). In our experiments , we used the four data sets examined by [ 33 ] _CITE_ and we choose λrow = . 01 and λcol = . 01 , which yielded approximately 25 – 40 % non - zero entries in X ( depending on the data set ). Rather than assuming we are given the Lipschitz constant L , on the first iteration we set L to 1 and following [ 2 ] we double our estimate anytime g ( xk ) & gt ; g ( yk − 1 ) + ( g & apos ;( yk − 1 ), xk − yk − 1 ) + ( L / 2 )|| xk − yk − 1 || . We tested three different ways to terminate the approximate proximal problem , each parameterized by a parameter α : Note that all three strategies lead to global convergence in the case of the basic proximal - gradient method , the first two give a convergence rate up to some fixed optimality tolerance , and in this paper we have shown that the first one ( for large enough α ) yields a convergence rate for an arbitrary optimality tolerance .__label__Material|Data|Use

In the following sections we describe in more detail the dataset used for training and testing , the system developed , the evaluation methodology , as well as ablation experiments aimed at studying the contribution of different feature types to the AA task . We show experimentally that discriminative models with appropriate feature types can achieve performance close to the upper bound , as defined by the agreement between human examiners on the same test corpus . The Cambridge Learner Corpus ( CLC ), developed as a collaborative project between Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment , is a large collection of texts produced by English language learners from around the world , sitting Cambridge Assessment ’ s English as a Second or Other Language ( ESOL ) examinations _CITE_ . For the purpose of this work , we extracted scripts produced by learners taking the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam , which assesses English at an upper - intermediate level . The scripts , which are anonymised , are annotated using XML and linked to meta - data about the question prompts , the candidate ’ s grades , native language and age .__label__Supplement|Website|Other

We have implemented both the abstract model and various instantiations using XML schemas ( Thompson , et al ., 2000 ), the Resource Definition Framework ( RDF ) ( Lassila and Swick , 2000 ) and RDF schemas ( Brickley and Guha , 2000 ), which enable description and definition of abstract data models together with means to interpret , via the model , information encoded according to different conventions . The results have been incorporated into XCES ( Ide , et al ., 2000a ), part of the EAGLES Guidelines developed by the Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards ( EAGLES ) _CITE_ . The XCES provides a ready - made , standard encoding format together with a data architecture designed specifically for linguistically annotated corpora .

Detergents can also complicate the accurate measurement of small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) data from solubilized proteins , where the background scattering from the buffer and free detergent micelles must be subtracted before data analysis can proceed . Whether this subtraction is even possible in a three - component system composed of protein – detergent complexes , free micelles and aqueous buffer depends strongly upon the type of detergent ( e . g . as discussed on the web site of the SIBYLS beamline at the Advanced Light Source , Berkeley , California , USA ; _CITE_ ). Furthermore , detergent micelles in a protein – detergent complex exhibit a different average electron density from the protein itself , with unknown structure , adding to the complexity of the data analysis . As a result of these fundamental limitations , there have been active efforts seeking other amphiphiles that are more suitable for structural studies .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

Deep congealing gives a significant improvement over SIFT congealing . Using a CDBN representation learned with a group sparsity penalty , leading to learned filters with topographic organization , consistently gives a higher accuracy of one to two percentage points . We compare with two supervised alignment systems , the fiducial points based system of [ 3 ], _CITE_ and LFW - a . Note that LFW - a was produced by a commercial alignment system , in the spirit of [ 3 ], but with important differences that have not been published [ 2 ]. Congealing with a one - layer CDBN trained on faces , with topology , gives verification accuracy significantly higher than using images produced by [ 3 ], and comparable to the accuracy using LFW - a images .__label__Method|Tool|Compare

If required the FGβ score can be converted back to an Fβ score at the end . The second recommendation is to use Precision - Recall - Gain curves instead of PR curves , and the third to use AUPRG which is easier to calculate than AUPR due to linear interpolation , has a proper interpretation as an expected F - Gain score and allows performance assessment over a range of operating points . To assist practitioners we have made R , Matlab and Java code to calculate AUPRG and PRG curves available at _CITE_ We are also working on closer integration of AUPRG as an evaluation metric in OpenML and performance visualisation platforms such as ViperCharts [ 15 ].

Regarding this , we would like to point out that researchers differ in their views regarding under which circumstances research practitioners in educational and psychological sciences should consider sensitivity analysis . Given that the MAR and MNAR assumptions cannot be tested [ 11 , 12 ] in everyday research practice , one cannot rule out MNAR missingness for a given dataset . Some methodologists indicate that this absence of information is in itself enough to underpin the need for sensitivity analysis [ 2 , 12 , PLOS ONE | _CITE_ September 13 , 2017 15 / 21 A tutorial example of sensitivity analysis : Gauging the influence of the missing - data technique 13 , 15 ]. In other words , when confronted with missing data , sensitivity analysis should be conducted . Others have argued that the chances of data violating the MAR assumptions to such a degree as to impact the results obtained are slim [ 35 , 38 ].__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

DSS does a much better job than metilene in this respect , although informME is clearly the best method among the three to accomplish this goal . For this reason , we provide in the following a further assessment of the performance of informME and DSS when applied on real data . We used gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis ( _CITE_ ) [ 44 ] to compare performance by evaluating the potential of informME to that of DSS for addressing a specific problem of interest to epigenetic biology : identifying biological processes that are significantly enriched in epigenetically dysregulated genes . By using GO enrichment analysis on gene lists of equal size formed by selecting genes with the largest detected methylation discordance at their promoters , we can remove the issue of sensitivity and specificity and focus on the ability of each method to produce biologically relevant results . It is important to note that the gene selection method used in [ 16 ] selects a gene by checking whether a statistic T , which counts the number of the top 2000 differentially methylated CpG sites in the gene , is above a threshold t = 4 .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

Having discussed the ideas driving the web - based teaching platform and exemplified one of the tools , we now return to the courses which have informed our work on the three core modules currently being developed in terms of their content and the use of a web - and implementation environment they make . ALE ( Carpenter and Penn , 1996 ) is a conservative extension of Prolog based on typed feature structures , with a built - in parser and semantic - headdriven generator . The demand for such a utility was so great when it was beta - released in 1992 that it immediately became the subject of early work in graphical front - end development for large constraint - based grammars : first with the Pleuk system ( Calder , 1993 ), then as one of several systems supported by Gertjan van Noord ’ s HDrug _CITE_ , followed by an ALE - mode Emacs user interface ( Laurens , 1995 ). It also provided the computational support for one of the very first web - based computational linguistics courses , Colin Matheson ’ s widely used HPSG Development in ALE .

In order to assess the performance of the final system , MAXENT was compared with support vector machines ( SVM ) using the SVMl ' ght toolkit ( Joachims , 1999 ).

This paper deal with Arabic language and its variants for the analysis of social media and the collaborative construction of linguistic tools , such as lexical dictionaries and grammars and their exploitation in NLP applications , such as translation technologies . Basically , Arabic is considered as morphologically rich and complex language , which presents significant challenges for NLP and its applications . It is the official language in 22 countries spoken by more than 350 million people around the world _CITE_ . Moreover , Arabic language exists in a state of diglossia where the standard form of the language , Modern Standard Arabic ( MSA ) and the regional dialects ( AD ) live side - by - side and are closely related ( Elfardy and Diab , 2013 ). Arabic has more than 22 variants , refereed a as dialects ; some countries share the same dialects , while many dialects may exist alongside MSA within the same Arab country .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

We test our algorithm on both toy and real world examples , on which we find our method tends to outperform a variety of baseline methods . Our code is available at _CITE_ Stein - Variational - Gradient - Descent . For all our experiments , we use RBF kernel k ( x , x & apos ;) = exp (− 1h || x − x & apos ;|| 22 ), and take the bandwidth to be h = med2 / log n , where med is the median of the pairwise distance between the current points { xi } n i = 1 ; this is based on the intuition that we would have Ej k ( xi , xj ) ≈ n exp (− 1 hmed2 ) = 1 , so that for each xi the contribution from its own gradient and the influence from the other points balance with each other . Note that in this way , the bandwidth h actually changes adaptively across the iterations .__label__Method|Code|Produce

Also , it is not surprising that haplotype frequencies estimated from the multiallelic data set are found to be less accurate than those estimated from SNPs , given the more complex nature of the data . The RCI is a relative measure , and illustrates not so much the accuracy of the algorithm , rather the effect of additional missing data . The results displayed in Tables 2 and 4 show that the algorithm handles the increase in the proportion of unknown alleles equally well for both SNPs and multiallelic data , although it should be pointed out that the RCI measure Page 9 of 13 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Bioinformatics 2004 , 5 : 188 _CITE_ hˆ gives no indication of the accuracy of the point estimates , and should generally be considered in tandem with a measure such as D ( h , ).

Different pollsters use different methodologies , reach different people , and may have sources of random errors , so generally the polls don ’ t fully agree with each other .

To a first - order approximation , they operate as follows : first they take the predictions of all the different pollsters , then they assign a weight to each of the pollsters based on past performance ( and other factors ), and finally they use the weighted average of the pollsters to run simulations and make their own prediction .

Graphs have long been used to describe linguistic annotations , most familiarly in the form of trees ( a graph in which each node has a single parent ) for syntactic annotation . Annotation Graphs ( Bird and Liberman , 2001 ) have been widely used to represent layers of annotation , each associated with primary data , although the concept was not extended to allow for annotations linked to other annotations and thus to consider multiple annotations as a single graph . More recently , the Penn Discourse TreeBank released its annotations of the Penn TreeBank as a graph , accompanied by an API that provides a set of standard graphhandling functions for query and access _CITE_ . The graph model therefore seems to be gaining ground as a natural and flexible model for linguistic annotations which , as we demonstrate below , can repre LAF provides a general framework for representing annotations that has been described elsewhere in detail ( Ide and Romary , 2004 , 2006 ).

Through evolution , structure is more conserved than sequence , so that detecting even very subtle sequence similarities , or remote homology , is important for predicting function . The major methods for homology detection can be split into three basic groups : pairwise sequence comparison algorithms [ 1 , 2 ], generative models for protein families [ 3 , 4 ], and discriminative classifiers [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Popular sequence comparison methods such as BLAST * Supplemental information for the paper , including the data sets and Matlab source code can be found on this author ’ s web page at _CITE_ and Smith - Waterman are based on unsupervised alignment scores . Generative models such as profile hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) model positive examples of a protein family , but they can be trained iteratively using both positively labeled and unlabeled examples by pulling in close homologs and adding them to the positive set . A compromise between these methods is PSI - BLAST [ 8 ], which uses BLAST to iteratively build a probabilistic profile of a query sequence and obtain a more sensitive sequence comparison score .__label__Method|Code|Produce

Secondary standards are also available , such as glassy carbon ( see the new NIST Standard Reference Material 3600 ; _CITE_ Allen et al ., 2017 ). Absolute scaling enables the direct comparison of SAS data from different instruments , including X - ray and neutron sources , without arbitrary scaling and also enables the determination of M or V from I ( 0 ) without reference to the scattering from a reference protein .

For the classification of the messages into the positive , negative and neutral classes we use three linear models , which were trained in an one - vs .- all manner . At prediction time we simply choose the label with the highest score . All training was done using the open - source machine learning toolkit scikitlearn , _CITE_ which provides a consistent Python API to fast implementations of various machine learning algorithms ( Pedregosa et al ., 2011 ). The linear models were trained using stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ), which is a gradient descent optimization method that minimizes a given loss function . The term “ stochastic ” refers to the fact that the weights of the model are updated for each training example , which is an approximation of batch gradient descent , in which all training examples are considered to make a single step .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Paired - end short - read libraries were aligned to the reference sequence generated above using BWA ( Li and Durbin , 2009 ) allowing for an edit distance of 4 between each read and the reference , except for samples from the population structure models which we mapped with an edit distance of 5 to accommodate the higher number of SNPs in these samples . Reads with duplicate mapping positions were removed with the rmdup function in SAMtools ( Li et al ., 2009a ).__label__Method|Code|Use
We set A = 1 in the first two experiments which yields roughly 20 , 000 non - zeros and varied A for the third experiment . Each of the components is trivially parallelized using OpenMP ( http :// openmp . org /). All timing experiments were conducted on the TACC Maverick system with Intel Xeon E5 - 2680 v2 Ivy Bridge CPUs ( 2 . 80 GHz ), 20 CPUs per node , and 12 . 8 GB memory per CPU ( _CITE_ ). The scaling is generally linear in the parameters except for fitting topic matrices which is O ( k2 ). For the AIS sampling , the scaling is linear in the number of non - zeros in 4 ) irrespective of p . Overall , we believe our implementations provide both good scaling and practical performance ( code available online ).__label__Method|Tool|Use
Since the 1980s , with the advent of computer technologies , digital equivalents of these camouflage techniques were invented to hide messages in digital cover media , such as images , video , and audio signals ( Fridrich 2009 ). For example , in 2010 , the United States Department of Justice documented that more than 100 text files were retrieved from images posted on publicly accessible Web sites . According to the Steganography Analysis and Research Centre , _CITE_ there have been over 1 , 100 digital steganography applications identified . Most of the digital steganography systems exploit the redundancy of the cover media and rely on the limitations of the human auditory or visual systems . For example , a standard image steganography system uses the least - significant - bit substitution technique .__label__Supplement|Website|Extent
Electronic career guidance is , thus , a supplement to career guidance by human experts , helping young people to decide which profession to choose . The goal is to automatically compute a ranked list of professions according to the user ’ s interests . A current system employed by the German Federal Labour Office ( GFLO ) in their automatic career guidance front - end _CITE_ is based on vocational trainings , manually annotated using a tagset of 41 keywords .

The reliable processing of temporal information is an important step in many NLP applications , such as information extraction , question answering , and document summarisation . Consequently , the tasks of identifying and assigning values to temporal expressions have recently received significant attention , resulting in the creation of mature corpus annotation guidelines ( e . g . TIMEX2 and TimeML _CITE_ ), publicly However , existing corpora have their limitations . In particular , the documents in these corpora tend to be limited in length and , in consequence , discourse structure . This impacts on the number , range and variety of temporal expressions they contain .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

Either we allow NNs as heads of VPs ( not very elegant but which is what we did ) or we have a VP without a head . The first solution might also introduce errors elsewhere ... As Ramshaw and Marcus ( 1995 ) already noted : " While this automatic derivation process introduced a small percentage of errors on its own , it was the only practical way both to provide the amount of training data required and to allow for fully - automatic testing ." For the CoNLL shared task , we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition ( Ramshaw and Marcus , 1995 ): WSJ sections 15 - 18 of the Penn Treebank as training material and section 20 as test materia1 _CITE_ .

The issue is particularly serious for large data , where direct second order methods cannot be used due to the computational constraints . While many approximate second - order methods are available , they rely on low - rank approximations and , as we discuss below , lead to over - regularization ( approximation bias ). In the second part of the paper we propose EigenPro iteration ( see _CITE_ for the code ), a direct and simple method to alleviate slow convergence resulting from fast eigen - decay for kernel ( and covariance ) matrices . EigenPro is a preconditioning scheme based on approximately computing a small number of top eigenvectors to modify the spectrum of these matrices . It can also be viewed as constructing a new kernel , specifically optimized for gradient descent .__label__Method|Code|Produce

Apply ing this method , we train an SMT model from English to Simple English , based on the PWKP parallel corpus generated from Wikipedia ( Zhu et al ., 2010 ); _CITE_ we use only alignments involving a single sentence on each side .

BMC Bioinformatics 2011 , 12 ( Suppl 15 ): S1 Page 4 of 10 _CITE_ statistical processes applied to biodiversity data . Recently , the European Union Framework Projects 6 project EDIT ( European Distributed Institute for Taxonomy ) has developed a complete workflow , from data collection in the field to assembly of datasets and analyses [ 19 , 20 ]. These and many other works provide guidance in the development of standard ontologies for data description .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce
Other more advanced optimization methods , such as L - BFGS and Newton ’ s method are also applicable . In this section , we demonstrate our algorithm on a set of real - world graphical models from recent UAI inference challenges , including two diagnostic Bayesian networks with 203 and 359 variables and max domain sizes 7 and 6 , respectively , and several MRFs for pedigree analysis with up to 1289 variables , max domain size of 7 and clique size 5 . _CITE_ We construct marginal MAP problems on these models by randomly selecting half of the variables to be max nodes , and the rest as sum nodes . We implement several algorithms that optimize the same primal marginal MAP bound , including our GDD ( Algorithm 1 ), the WMB algorithm in [ 16 ] with ibound = 1 , which uses the same cliques and a fixed point heuristic for optimization , and an off - the - shelf L - BFGS implementation that directly optimizes our decomposed bound . For comparison , we also computed several related primal bounds , including standard mini - bucket [ 2 ] and elimination reordering [ 27 , 38 ], limited to the same computational limits ( ibound = 1 ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce
Our results suggested that the observed effect may reflect the intrinsic dynamic preferences of kinase clients , in which these N - lobe regions may be especially vulnerable to perturbations and form weak spots of kinase instability . These findings are consistent with similar effects seen in oncogenic kinases that are typically chaperone clients , where activation mutations are mainly assembled in a more flexible N - lobe that allows to readily modulating activation transitions [ 125 , 126 ]. Structural separation of stable PLOS ONE | _CITE_ December21 , 2017 13 / 34 A model of chaperoning kinase clients by exploiting weak spots of intrinsically dynamic kinase domains and flexible regions in the chaperone - kinase complex highlight the notion that protein polarity can be required to afford evolution of new functions without sacrificing fold stability [ 127 – 129 ]. Energetic analysis of protein - protein binding interfaces in the Hsp90 - Cdc37 - Cdk4 complex differentiates hotspot residues and quantifies functional role of the Cdc37 - M / C domain We also performed alanine scanning of the binding interfaces in the Hsp90 - Cdc37 - Cdk4 complex by computing changes in protein - protein binding free energies induced by mutations of the interfacial residues ( Figs 6 and 7 ). The central objective of this analysis was to determine energetic hotspots of protein binding and stability in the complex and quantify role of these functional residues in the allosteric mechanism of the chaperone - kinase cycle .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

In ( Bunt , 2006 ); ( Bunt and Girard , 2005 ) a dimension in dialogue act analysis is defined as an aspect ofparticipating in dialogue which can be addressed : The independence of dimensions , required by this definition , has the effect that an utterance may have a function in one dimension independent of the functions that it may have in other dimensions , and helps to explain why utterances may have multiple functions . Moreover , it leads to more manageable and more adaptable annotation schemas ( compared to , for instance , DAMSL and its derivatives ), since it allows annotators to leave out certain dimensions that they are not interested in , or to extend the schema with additional dimensions ; and it allows restricting or modifying the set of tags in a particular dimension without affecting the rest of the schema . Based on the above definition and extensive theoretical and empirical studies , 10 dimensions are defined in the DIT ++ dialogue act annotation scheme _CITE_ : the domain or task / activity ( Task ); feedback on the processing of previous utterances by the speaker ( Auto - feedback ) or by other interlocutors ( Allofeedback ); managing difficulties in the speaker ’ s utterance production ( Own - Communication Management , OCM ) or that of other interlocutors ( Partner Communication Management , PCM ); the speaker ’ s need for time to continue the dialogue ( Time Management ); establishing and maintaining contact ( Contact Management ); the allocation of the next turn ( Turn Management ); the way the speaker is planning to structure the dialogue ( Dialogue Structuring ); and attention for social aspects of the interaction ( Social Obligations Management , SOM ).

We see the difficulty of both data access and data sharing as an indicator of a general problem with current data sharing mechanisms : we believe that the ease of use , discoverability , availability and accessibility of data resources are crucial for promoting and facilitating data sharing for the genomics research community . The challenges of data sharing have been discussed extensively in the human genomics research community , since sharing of samples , data and results is an essential building block for progressing the body of knowledge in the field ( Callier et al ., 2014 ). Several organisations including the Research Data Alliance ( RDA ; _CITE_ ) and the Human Variome Project ( HVP ; http :// www . humanvariomeproject . org ) have made great efforts to promote capturing and sharing of research data , but hurdles in sharing genomic data still remain . In 2013 , the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ( GA4GH ; http :// genomicsandhealth . org ) was established and has since engaged more than 180 institutions and organisations in working groups to address the challenges of regulatory restrictions , ethics , clinical demands , data representation , storage , analysis , and security related to genomic data sharing .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

Exact implementations and specifications differ between pseudotime approaches particularly in the way “ similarity ” is defined . When applied to molecular data , pseudotime analysis typically captures some dominant mode of variation that corresponds to the continuous ( de ) activation of a set of biological pathways1 . Pseudotime analysis has gained particular popularity in the domain of single - cell gene expression analysis ( where each “ individual ” is now a single cell ) in which it has been applied to model the differentiation of single - cells2 – 9 ( a comprehensive catalogue of single - cell pseudotime algorithms can be obtained from _CITE_ ). Using advanced machine learning techniques , these methods can be applied to characterise complex , nonlinear behaviours , such as cell cycle , and modelling branching behaviours to allow , for example , the possibility of cell fate decision making and lineage reconstruction . However , these single - cell applications were predated b1y more general applications in modeling cancer progression 10 – 2 , as well as other progressive diseases1 - 16 Examples of such work provided early inspiration for single - cell pseudotime methods , e . g ., Monocle2 .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use
Firstly , a corpus of articles was created ( Section 3 . 1 ), after which the documents were automatically annotated with named entities ( Section 3 . 2 ). We then extracted a number features relevant to the named entities present in the corpus ( Section 3 . 3 ). Our corpus was created by first searching the NLM Catalog _CITE_ for journals whose Broad Subject Term attributes contain only cell biology or pharmacology , and then narrowing down the results to those which are in English and available via PubMed Central . Also , since we are concentrating on full - text documents , we retained only those journals that are available within the PubMed Open Access subset . According to this procedure , we obtained a final list of two journals for cell biology and six for pharmacology .__label__Supplement|Website|Use

In this experiment we evaluated our method ’ s capability to reconstruct the evolutionary history of populations represented in the 1000 genomes dataset , which consists of whole genome sequences of 1 , 092 human individuals from 14 distinct populations . We used a trinary representation wherein each individual is represented as a vector of features corresponding to 0 , 1 or 2 . Every feature represents a known genetic variation ( with respect to the standard human reference genome _CITE_ ), where the number indicates the number of varied genome copies . We used data processed by the 1000 Genomes Consortium , which initially contained 2 . 25 million variations . To reduce dimensionality , we used the 1 , 000 features that had the highest information gain with respect to the populations .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

Traditional QA : In this scenario answers are dynamically constructed from larger documents ( Pasca , 2001 ). We use this setup to answer questions from a biology textbook , where each section is indexed as a standalone document , and each paragraph in a given document is considered as a candidate answer . We implemented the document indexing and retrieval stage using Lucene _CITE_ . The candidate answers are scored using a linear interpolation of two cosine similarity scores : one between the entire parent document and question ( to model global context ), and a second between the answer candidate and question ( for local context ). Because the number of answer candidates is typically large ( e . g ., equal to the number of paragraphs in the textbook ), we return the N top candidates with the highest scores .__label__Method|Tool|Use

RoM is calculated as the mean CSF concentration in the AD group divided by the mean CSF concentration in the Ctl group for each marker in each study . Standard error for the natural logarithm for the RoM in each study , SE ( ln [ RoM ]) was calculated according to Friedrich [ 32 , 33 ]: SE [ ln ( RoM )] = SQRT (( 1 / n AD ) ( Standard Deviation AD / mean AD ) 2 + ( 1 / n Ctl ) ( Standard Deviation Ctl / mean Ctl ) 2 ), where “ n ” is the number of patients in the AD and Ctl groups , respectively . These calculations were performed in an Excel spreadsheet prior to entering the resulting data into the meta - analysis software of the Cochrane Collaboration , Review Manager , Version 5 ( Revman , Cochrane Collaboration , Oxford , England , freely available at _CITE_ ) and analyzed using the random effects model .

Figure 3 summarizes the performances of the detectors for a set of objects on isolated patches ( not whole images ) taken from the test set . The results vary in quality since some objects are harder to recognize than others , and because some objects have less training data . When we trained and tested our detector on the training / testing sets of side - views of cars from UIUC _CITE_ , we outperformed the detector of [ 1 ] at every point on the precision - recall curve ( results not shown ), suggesting that our base - line detectors can match state - of - the - art detectors when given enough training data .

In some settings , the λ that yields the best generalization error scales like O ( 1 / Vn ), hence p = O ( Tr ( K )/ Vn ) is sufficient . On the other hand , if the columns are sampled uniformly , one would get p = O ( dmof ) = O ( n maxi li ( λ )). We test our results based on several datasets : one synthetic regression problem from [ 3 ] to illustrate the importance of the λ - ridge leverage scores , the Pumadyn family consisting of three datasets pumadyn - 32fm , pumadyn - 32fh and pumadyn - 32nh _CITE_ and the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset from the UCI database . The synthetic case consists of a regression problem on the interval X = [ 0 , 1 ] where , given a sequence ( xi ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n and a sequence of noise ( Ei ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n , we observe the sequence The function f belongs to the RKHS F generated by the kernel k ( x , y ) = 1 ( 2β )! B2β ( x − y − Lx − yI ) where B2β is the 2β - th Bernoulli polynomial [ 3 ]. One important feature of this regression problem is the distribution of the points ( xi ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n on the interval X : if they are spread uniformly over the interval , the λ - ridge leverage scores ( li ( λ )) 1 ≤ i ≤ n are uniform for every λ & gt ; 0 , and uniform column sampling is optimal in this case .__label__Material|Data|Use

Their inputs are often statement sentences which include subject and object entities for a given predicate , whereas NLquestions lack either a subject or object entity that is the potential answer .

Furthermore , experimentaldata - constrained RNA secondary structures are not available for RBP binding sites in any current database . Finally , it is often desirable to know whether RBPs can interact with RNA molecules , especially novel lncRNAs ; however , only a few online tools ( 21 , 22 ) are available for predicting RBP binding sites on given RNA sequences .

The MKL experiments reported in Table 1 took less than 1 minute ( for each graph family ); while the algorithm in [ 14 ] aborts after several hours due to memory constraints . Planted clique recovery We generate 100 random graphs based on planted clique model G ( n , 1 / 2 , k ) where n = 30000 and hidden clique size k = 2t √ n for each choice of t . We evaluate the recovery algorithm discussed in Section 4 . 2 . The SVM problem is solved using Libsvm _CITE_ . For t ≥ 2 we find perfect recovery of the clique on all the graphs , which is agreement with Theorem 5 . 1 . It is worth noting that the approach takes 10 minutes to recover the clique in this graph of 30000 vertices which is far beyond the scope of SDP based procedures .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Data weighting approaches ( Matsoukas et al ., 2009 ; Foster et al ., 2010 ; Huang and Xiang , 2010 ; Phillips and Brown , 2011 ; Sennrich , 2012 ) use a rich feature set to decide on weights for the training data , at the sentence or phrase pair level .

The implementation of this is available at _CITE_ In the population model , the calculation of the p - value must be different , because the variance is not being left as a free parameter , so we take a more classical approach .

Novel research directions we investigated include : neural network language models and bilingual neural network language models , a comprehensive use of word classes , and sparse lexicalized reordering features . The Edinburgh / JHU phrase - based translation systems for our participation in the WMT 2015 shared translation task are based on the open source Moses toolkit ( Koehn et al ., 2007 ). We built upon Edinburgh ’ s strong baselines from WMT submissions in previous years ( Durrani et al ., 2014a ) as well as our recent research within the framework of other evaluation campaigns and projects such as IWSLT and EU - BRIDGE _CITE_ ( Birch et al ., 2014 ; Freitag et al ., 2014a ; Freitag et al ., 2014b ).

PARSEVAL results on the development and test set are presented in Tables 5 and 6 . We see that the reranked models outperform the generative baseline model in terms of F1 , and that the reranked model that uses extra - sentential context outperforms the version that does not use extra - sentential context in the development set , but not in the test set . Using Bikel ’ s randomized parsing evaluation comparator _CITE_ , we find that both reranking models outperform the baseline generative model to statistical significance for recall and precision . The context - ignorant reranker outperforms the context - aware reranker on recall ( p & lt ; 0 . 01 ), but not on precision ( p = 0 . 42 ). However , the context - aware model has the highest exact match scores in both the development and the test set .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Infinite Impulse Response ( IIR ) filters have a significant advantage over Finite Impulse Response ( FIR ) filters in signal processing : the length of the impulse response is uncoupled from the number of filter parameters . The length of the impulse response is related to the memory depth of a system , and hence IIR filters allow a greater memory depth than FIR filters of the same order . However , IIR filters are * _CITE___label__Method|Tool|Introduce

These approaches all belong to the family of channel features detectors , and as the improvements proposed in this work are orthogonal , the methods could potentially be combined . Caltech Results : We present our main result on the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset [ 10 ], see Fig . 5 ( b ), generated using the official evaluation code available online _CITE_ . The Caltech dataset has become the standard for evaluating pedestrian detectors and the latest methods based on deep learning ( JointDeep ) [ 25 ], multi - resolution models ( MT - DPM ) [ 36 ] and motion features ( ACF + SDt ) [ 27 ] achieve under 40 % log - average MR .

SGD - SPV and SGD - SE perform significantly better than SGD - Uni here , consistent with the idea that avoiding difficult examples increases robustness to outliers . For CIFAR 100 [ 24 ], we demonstrate that the proposed approaches can also work in very deep residual networks [ 16 ]. _CITE_ To show the method is not sensitive to the network depth and the number of burn - in epochs , we present results from the network with 27 layers and 90 burn - in epochs as well as the network with 63 layers and 50 burn - in epochs . Without changing architectures , emphasizing uncertain or easy examples gains around 0 . 5 % in both settings , which is significant considering the fact that the much deeper network shows only 3 % improvement here .

In this paper , we bring these two parallel views together , grounding the linguistic realization of these relations in the semantics of planning operations . The challenge and opportunity of this fusion comes from the mismatch between the abstractions of human language and the granularity of planning primitives . Consider , for example , text describing a virtual world such as Minecraft _CITE_ and a formal description of that world using planning primitives . Due to the mismatch in granularity , even the simple relations between wood , pickaxe and stone described in the sentence in Figure 1a results in dozens of lowlevel planning actions in the world , as can be seen in Figure 1b . While the text provides a high - level description of world dynamics , it does not provide sufficient details for successful plan execution .__label__Supplement|Media|Introduce

After the variant calling file ( VCF ) has been obtained , a filtering procedure is often necessary for the downstream analysis . This filtering procedure aims to reduce the number of false positives corresponding either to low quality and common variants . In particular the common variants , which are assumed to have no implications in tumor development and progression , are filtered out by comparison with the germline polymorphisms collected in publicly available databases , such as dbSNP [ 29 ] or EVS ( Exome Variant Server , _CITE_ ). The most recent versions of dbSNP ( build 142 ) contains more than 110 million human SNPs , while the current EVS data release ( ESP6500SI - V2 ) include all the exome variant data from 6503 human samples .

In Table 3 , we report the average test set accuracy (%) and CPU time ( seconds ) across different algorithms : smooth optimization method ( SMM ), simplified projected gradient method ( SPGM ), analytic center cutting plane method ( ACCPM ), and semi - infinite quadratically constrained linear programming ( SIQCLP ). For the QCLP sub - problem in the SIQCLP method , we use Mosek software package ( _CITE_ ).

In some settings , the λ that yields the best generalization error scales like O ( 1 / Vn ), hence p = O ( Tr ( K )/ Vn ) is sufficient .

One important feature of this regression problem is the distribution of the points ( xi ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n on the interval X : if they are spread uniformly over the interval , the λ - ridge leverage scores ( li ( λ )) 1 ≤ i ≤ n are uniform for every λ & gt ; 0 , and uniform column sampling is optimal in this case .__label__Material|Data|Use

First , our results may be idiosyncratic to the specifics of the particular domain of our experiment . We would point out , however , that the domain is more complex , and arguably more realistic , than the much - simplified experimental contexts that have served as intuitions for earlier work in the field ; we have in mind here in particular the experiments discussed in ( Ford and Olson , 1975 ), ( Sonnenschein , 1985 ) and ( Pechmann , 1989 ). In the belief that the data provides a good test set for the generation of referring expressions , we are making the data set publicly available _CITE_ , so others may try to develop algorithms covering the data . A second concern is that we have only explored the extent to which three specific algorithms are able to cover the human data .

But viruses like HCMV , EBV , SV40 and low - risk HPVs were identified in some of the Chinese prostate tissues ( both cancer and adjacent samples ) in Data set 3 . The presence of both HPV and EBV gene sequences were present in an equal proportion of normal , benign , and PCa specimens from Australian males . However , using a range of analytical techniques including the in situ polymerase chain reaction ( IS - PCR ) and the standard liquid PCR before finally sequencing the product [ 21 ], no DNA virus transcripts were detected in the PCa samples using RNA - seq data from the TCGA Portal ( _CITE_ ) [ 61 , 62 ]. The different results from different studies are most likely attributable to sample differences : ethnic difference , pathological difference , etc .

Our work also shows that collaboration between groups developing ontologies and creating biological annotations and scientists and clinicians engaged in active research can lead to substantial improvements in the computational representation of biological knowledge . The GOC welcomes input from researchers about any aspect of our work , including changes to the ontology and suggestions of papers and gene products to annotate ( goannotation @ ucl . ac . uk , http :// geneontology . org / page / contributing - go ). A variety of GitHub repositories with issue trackers are in place for specific queries : for general inquiries about GO ( _CITE_ ), for specific questions about annotations or annotation - related topics ( https :// github . com / geneontology / go - annotation /), and for specific questions or suggestions about the content and structure of the ontology ( https :// github . com / geneontology / go - ontology /). Such collaborations improve the value of the GO resource for the benefit of the entire cardiovascular research community and facilitate the interpretation of high - throughput data sets , toward the identification of dysregulated cardiac pathways , as well as variants and risk alleles , associated with cardiovascular diseases . This has important implications for cardiovascular physicians needing to interpret potentially pathological variants in their patients as a resource for the most up - to - date bioinformatic data to inform diagnosis and cascade screening in families .__label__Method|Code|Introduce

From the latter standpoint , we show that the standard deep generator architecture is powerful at modelling complex escorts of any deformed exponential family , factorising a number of escorts in order of the total inner layers ’ dimensions , and this factorization happens for an especially compact design . This hints on a simple sufficient condition on the activation function to guarantee the escort modelling , and it turns out that this condition is satisfied , exactly or in a limit sense , by most popular activation functions ( ELU , ReLU , Softplus , ...). We also provide experiments _CITE_ that display the uplift that can be obtained through a principled design of the activation function ( generator ), or tuning of the link function ( discriminator ).

The other rows compare estimators relative to the pure MC RGE variance — a value of 100 indicates equal variation L = 10 samples , a value of 1 indicates a 100 - fold decrease in variance ( lower is better ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

The extraction can be restricted to the top N words to generate a summary of specified length . In our study each document contains a list of topscoring responses from the dataset , i . e ., each topscoring response would constitute a sentence . For our study we use MEAD _CITE_ to extract summaries of length that match the lengths of the summaries generated by the graph - based cohesion technique . The choice of cluster to which a response is added depends on the cluster ’ s similarity , i . e ., a response is added to the cluster with higher similarity . If both responses ( in the pair ) have same cluster similarities , then the larger cluster is chosen as the target .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Today , DNNs are almost exclusively trained on one or many very fast and power - hungry Graphic Processing Units ( GPUs ) ( Coates et al ., 2013 ). As a result , it is often a challenge to run DNNs on target low - power devices , and substantial research efforts are invested in speeding up DNNs at run - time on both general - purpose ( Gong et al ., 2014 ; Han et al ., 2015b ) and specialized computer hardware ( Chen et al ., 2014 ; Esser et al ., 2015 ). This paper makes the following contributions : The code for training and running our BNNs is available on - line ( both Theano _CITE_ and Torch framework ).

Acceleration with Structured Transforms : In Figure 3 , we analyze the speedup obtained in practice using n × n Circulant and Toeplitz - like matrices relative to a dense unstructured n × n matrix ( fully connected layer ) as a function of displacement rank and dimension n . Three scenarios are considered : inference speed per test instance , training speed as implicitly dictated by forward passes on a minibatch , and gradient computations on a minibatch . Factors such as differences in cache optimization , SIMD vectorization and multithreading between Level - 2 BLAS ( matrix - vector multiplication ), Level - 3 BLAS ( matrix - matrix multiplication ) and FFT implementations ( we use FFTW : _CITE_ ) influence the speedup observed in practice . Speedup gains start to show for dimensions as small as 512 for Circulant matrices . The gains become dramatic with acceleration of the order of 10 to 100 times for several thousand dimensions , even for higher displacement rank Toeplitz - like transforms .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The results are presented in Figure 3 for MuJoCo and Figure 4 for Atari . Training the reward predictor offline can lead to bizarre behavior that is undesirable as measured by the true reward ( Amodei et al ., 2016 ). For instance , on Pong offline training sometimes leads our agent to avoid losing points but not to score points ; this can result in extremely long volleys ( videos at _CITE_ ). This type of behavior demonstrates that in general human feedback needs to be intertwined with RL rather than provided statically . Our main motivation for eliciting comparisons rather than absolute scores was that we found it much easier for humans to provide consistent comparisons than consistent absolute scores , especially on the continuous control tasks and on the qualitative tasks in Section 3 . 2 ; nevertheless it seems important to understand how using comparisons affects performance .__label__Supplement|Media|Produce

Political debates are an interesting example : political scientists carefully analyze what gets said in debates to explore how candidates shape the debate ’ s agenda and frame issues or how answers subtly ( or not so subtly ) shift the conversation by dodging the question that was asked ( Rogers and Norton , 2011 ). Computational methods can contribute to the analysis of topical dynamics , for example through topic segmentation , dividing a conversation into smaller , topically coherent segments ( Purver , 2011 ); or through identifying and summarizing the topics under discussion ( Blei et al ., 2003 ; Blei , 2012 ). However , the topics uncovered by such methods can be difficult for people to interpret ( Chang et al ., 2009 ), and previous visualization frameworks for topic models — e . g ., ParallelTopics ( Dou et al ., 2011 ), TopicViz ( Eisenstein et al ., 2012 ), the Topical Guide , _CITE_ or topic model visualization ( Chaney and Blei , 2012 )— are not particularly well suited for linearly structured conversations .

Detergents can also complicate the accurate measurement of small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) data from solubilized proteins , where the background scattering from the buffer and free detergent micelles must be subtracted before data analysis can proceed . Whether this subtraction is even possible in a three - component system composed of protein – detergent complexes , free micelles and aqueous buffer depends strongly upon the type of detergent ( e . g . as discussed on the web site of the SIBYLS beamline at the Advanced Light Source , Berkeley , California , USA ; _CITE_ ). Furthermore , detergent micelles in a protein – detergent complex exhibit a different average electron density from the protein itself , with unknown structure , adding to the complexity of the data analysis .

It has been shown that using syntactic information can improve the accuracy of sentiment models ( Joshi and Ros ´ e , 2009 ). Thus , instead of representing documents as a bag of words , we will experiment with using features returned by a dependency parser . For this , we used the Stanford parser _CITE_ , which returns dependency tuples of the form rel ( a , b ) where rel is some dependency relation and a and b are tokens of a sentence . We can use these specific tuples as features , referred here as the full - tuple representation . One problem with this representation is that we are using very specific information and it is harder for learning algorithms to find patterns due to the lack of redundancy .__label__Method|Tool|Use

It is basically the same as the vanilla Viterbi search often used for Japanese morphological analysis ( Kudo et al ., 2004 ), except that it runs on a consonant sequence .

Another disadvantage of human odor observers relative to dispersion models is that models can be used for predictive [ 9 ] and hypothetical scenarios , though these are not relevant to our application , so we focused on thorough data gathering and analysis using human odor observation rather than splitting our resources between those techniques and dispersion modeling . Our human odor observers were first trained and tested for their olfactory sensitivity by the use of the ASTM E544 - 10 standardized olfactory perception practice for determining odor type and concentration [ 11 ]. The choice of ASTM E544 - 10 is supported quantitatively by a careful comparison of seven different well - established techniques for odor detection that showed , using least significant difference ( LSD ) multiple comparison results , that all of the common field techniques tested were statistically indistinguishable from one another in their session means , and only a laboratory - based dynamic triangular forced - choice olfactometry ( DTFCO ) approach ( that collected samples in Tedlar bags for later laboratory evaluation by a group of panelists ) produced significantly different results , with the latter difference probably PLOS ONE | _CITE_ January31 , 2018 3 / 30 Combining Ordinary Kriging with wind directions to identify sources of industrial odors in Portland due to the collection bags having had a detectable background odor [ 12 ].

In this way , the input of the score function is dynamically adapted to the start - end behavior , but a classification feedback is given to each function for each decision taken . The functions of the system were actually modeled as Voted Perceptrons [ 11 ], which compute a prediction as an average of all vectors generated during training . For the batch classification setting , we modeled the functions as Voted Perceptrons and also as SVMs _CITE_ . In all cases , a function can be expressed in dual form as a combination of training instances , which allows the use of kernel functions . We work with polynomial kernels of degree 2 .__label__Method|Tool|Extent

Graphs have long been used to describe linguistic annotations , most familiarly in the form of trees ( a graph in which each node has a single parent ) for syntactic annotation . Annotation Graphs ( Bird and Liberman , 2001 ) have been widely used to represent layers of annotation , each associated with primary data , although the concept was not extended to allow for annotations linked to other annotations and thus to consider multiple annotations as a single graph . More recently , the Penn Discourse TreeBank released its annotations of the Penn TreeBank as a graph , accompanied by an API that provides a set of standard graphhandling functions for query and access _CITE_ . The graph model therefore seems to be gaining ground as a natural and flexible model for linguistic annotations which , as we demonstrate below , can repre LAF provides a general framework for representing annotations that has been described elsewhere in detail ( Ide and Romary , 2004 , 2006 ). Its development has built on common practice and convergence of approach in linguistic annotation over the past 15 - 20 years .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

( 2002 ), who define MWEs as : different but related phenomena [ which ] can be described as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis . This generic and intentionally vague definition can be narrowed down according to the application needs . For example , for the statistical machine translation ( MT ) system _CITE_ used in the examples shown in Table 1 , an MWE is any sequence of words which , when not translated as a unit , generates errors : ungrammatical or unnatural verbal constructions ( sentence 1 ), awkward literal translations of idioms ( sentence 2 ) and problems of lexical choice and word order in specialised texts ( sentence 3 ). These examples illustrate the importance of correctly dealing with MWEs in MT applications and , more generally , MWEs can speed up and help remove ambiguities in many current NLP applications , for example : Despite the importance of MWEs in several applications , they are often neglected in the design and construction of real - life systems . In 1993 , Smadja pointed out that “... although disambiguation was originally considered as a performance task , the collocations retrieved have not been used for any specific computational task .” Most of the recent and current research in the MWE community still focuses on MWE acquisition instead of integration of automatically acquired or manually compiled resources into applications .__label__Method|Tool|Introduce
Since the output is generated via templates , other formats could also be generated to feed into alternate tools . In addition to generating existing XML formats it is also useful to generate data in a form that is easily consumed by custom applications . JSON ( Javascript Object Notation _CITE_ ) is a data format that is frequently used to transport data in modern web applications and is easily parsed by libraries in many target languages . The DADA JSON interface will deliver descriptions of any kind of object in the data store in a way that makes it easy to implement clients that present interactive displays of the data . As a demonstration of the web based API allowing remote clients to read annotation data from the server , we have implemented a Javascript based browser for annotation data that is able to show data aligned with the source video data .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The latter makes this extraction methodology suitable for inflecting languages ( Russian in our case ) where frequencies of ngrams are low . Porting the NP extractor from English to Russian consisted in substituting English stop lexicons of the tool with the Russian equivalents . We did this by translating each of the English stop lists into Russian using a free online system PROMT ( _CITE_ ) followed by manual brush - up . The NP extractor does not rely on a preconstructed corpus , works on small texts , does not miss low frequency units and can reliably extract all NPs from an input text . We excluded a lemmatizer from the original extraction algorithm and kept all extracted Russian NPs in their textual forms .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Consistent with observed timing of the cell ’ s response to cAMP stimulation , we find that the directional signal converges quickly enough for the cell to make a decision about which direction to move within the first two seconds following stimulus onset . Using MCell and DReAMM [ 10 , 11 ] we construct a spherical cell ( radius R = 7 . 5µm , [ 12 ]) centered in a cubic volume ( side length L = 30µm ). N = 980 triangular tiles partition the surface ( mesh generated by DOME _CITE_ ); each contained one cell surface receptor for cAMP with binding rate k + = 4 . 4 x 10 sec − _CITE_M − _CITE_ , first - order cAMP unbinding rate k − = 1 . 1 sec − _CITE_ [ 12 ] and Keq = k −/ k + = 25nMol cAMP . We established a baseline concentration of approximately 1nMol by releasing a cAMP bolus at time 0 inside the cube with zero - flux boundary conditions imposed on each wall .

Typically , these Bayesian approaches aim to explicitly represent the unknown objective function of ( 1 ) by entertaining a posterior distribution over the space of objective functions . In contrast , we aim to model directly the distribution of the maximum of ( 2 ) conditioned on observations . Our model is intuitively straightforward and easy to implement _CITE_ . Let h ( x ) : X → R be an estimate of the mean ¯ f ( x ) constructed from data Dt := {( xi , yi )} ti = 1 ( Figure 1a , left ). This estimate can easily be converted into a posterior pdf over the location of the maximum by first multiplying it with a precision parameter α > 0 and then taking the normalized exponential ( Figure 1a , right ) In this transformation , the precision parameter α controls the certainty we have over our estimate of the maximizing argument : α ≈ 0 expresses almost no certainty , while α → ∞ expresses certainty .__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce

We experimented with various combinations of E1 - and E2 - loss SVMs , with both E1 and E2 - regularization , but in the end opted to use the E2 - regularized logistic regression due to slightly superior performance and the ease with which we could extract eleven values of P ( H ) for inclusion in our ensemble . Another component that was tested in development of our ensemble systems was a maximum entropy classifier . This particular effort used the implementation from JCarafe , _CITE_ which uses L - BFGS for optimization .

We therefore experiment with three types of machine learning algorithms : a standard classifier , an ordinal ( ranking ) classifier and a regressor . Each algorithm assumes different relations among the groups : the classifier assumes no relation , the ordinal classifier assumes that the groups are ordered , and the regressor assumes that the groups are continuous . As classifier we use the Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) implementation in the Weka _CITE_ toolkit ( SMO ). As ordinal classifier we use a meta classifier in Weka which takes SMO as the base classification algorithm and performs pairwise classifications ( OrdinalClassClassifier ). For regression we use the SVM regression implementation in Weka ( SMO - reg ).__label__Method|Code|Use

But an understanding of how these methods relate and when one method is preferable to another is still lacking . Here , we present a novel unified approach to interpreting model predictions . _CITE_ Our approach leads to three potentially surprising results that bring clarity to the growing space of methods : The best explanation of a simple model is the model itself ; it perfectly represents itself and is easy to understand . For complex models , such as ensemble methods or deep networks , we cannot use the original model as its own best explanation because it is not easy to understand . Instead , we must use a simpler explanation model , which we define as any interpretable approximation of the original model .__label__Method|Algorithm|Produce

The first column contains query words , on the right are the 5 words with smallest Euclidean distance in the embedded space . We can see that they are quite relevant . Cross Language Retrieval [ 16 ] is the task of retrieving documents in a target language E given a query in a different source language F . For example , Google provides such a service _CITE_ . This is an interesting case for word - based learning to rank models which can naturally deal with this task without the need for machine translation as they directly learn the correspondence between the two languages from bi - lingual labeled data in the form of tuples R . The use of a non - symmetric lowrank model like ( 3 ) also naturally suits this task ( however in this case adding the identity does not make sense ).

Hierarchical clustering using complete linkage algorithm and the Jaccard distance between identified peptides was used to determine the dissimilarity of the metaproteome [ 34 ]. Hierarchical clustering ( complete linkage ) was also applied to the oligonucleotide profiles using 1 - Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient ( r ) as the similarity measure . Split violin plots ( R package vioplot and _CITE_ ) were used to visualize the distribution of relative abundances of bacterial phyla both for phylogenetic microarray and proteomic data .

Although we did not find a direct negative relationship between evolutionary rate per se and evidence for competition ( S17 Fig ), there is a trend in the predicted direction , and together with estimates of disparity and divergence , our results are consistent with a model of evolution in which the impact of interspecific competition is negatively related to evolutionary rates : traits either evolve rapidly ( e . g ., under social selection ) and escape the effect of competition upon secondary contact , or they evolve slowly and thus are subject to the effect of interspecific competition in sympatry . We note that there are other possible reasons for why we did not detect a consistent effect of competition on traits involved in social interactions .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce

In contrast to these promising PLOS ONE | _CITE_ March 12 , 2018 2 / 25 Efficacy of the LMC for assessment of upper limb movements results using simulated human movement , more recent studies reported significantly greater spatial error for actual pointing movements performed to targets presented on a computer monitor .

They also found that movement time was significantly longer with the LMC compared with the mouse movements ( 945 vs . 565 ms ).__label__Supplement|Paper|Compare

These differences yield an important consequence : VDMGP can infer automatically the latent dimensionality K of data , but SPGP - DR is unable to , since increasing K is never going to decrease its likelihood . Thus , VDMGP follows Occam ’ s razor on the number of latent dimensions K . We will assess VDMGP on real - world datasets . For this purpose we will use the two data sets from the WCCI - 2006 Predictive Uncertainty in Environmental Modeling Competition run by Gavin Cawley _CITE_ , called Temp and SO2 . In dataset Temp , maximum daily temperature measurements have to be predicted from 106 input variables representing large - scale circulation information . For the SO2 dataset , the task is to predict the concentration of SO2 in an urban environment twenty - four hours in advance , using information on current SO2 levels and meteorological conditions .__label__Material|Data|Use
In fact , the adherence to one model rather than another has an impact on who should be performing the evaluation . Senseval - 2 was in line with Putnam ’ s view of ‘ division of linguistic labour ’ by relying on lexicographers ’ judgments to build a gold standard ( Kilgarrif , 1998 ). On the other hand , Senseval - 3 collected data via Open - Mind Initiative _CITE_ , which was much more in line with Fodor ’ s view that any common people can use their own similarity metric to disambiguate polysemous terms . Interestingly , a recent empirical study ( Murray and Green 2004 ) showed how judgments by ordinary people were consistent among themselves but different from the one of lexicographers . It is important to decide who the best judges are ; a decision which can certainly be based on the foreseen application , but also , as we suggest here , on some theoretical grounds .__label__Material|Data|Introduce

Individual tag ID was used as a random effect in the GAMMs to account for autocorrelation within each track . Deviance explained was calculated as the ratio of the deviance of the full model compared to the deviance of the null model . Potential confounding between statistically significant covariates was investigated with variance inflation factors ( VIF ) [ 49 – 51 ] using the corvif function available at _CITE_ [ 50 , 51 ]. Model selection was performed manually , one variable at a time , and we retained candidate predictors that were statistically significant at the 0 . 05 level , maximized the amount of deviance explained and exhibited a VIF lower than 3 .

We manually checked all the cases of majority agreement , correcting only 7 . 92 % of the majority adjudications , and manually adjudicated all the snippets for which there was no agreement . We observed during adjudication that in many cases the disagreement was due to the existence of subtle sense distinctions , like between MORTAL KOMBAT ( VIDEO GAME ) and MORTAL KOMBAT ( 2011 VIDEO GAME ), or between THE DA VINCI CODE and INACCURACIES IN THE DA VINCI CODE . The average number of senses associated with the search results of each query was 7 . 69 ( higher than in previous datasets , such as AMBIENT + MORESQUE _CITE_ , which associates 5 . 07 senses per query on average ). Following Di Marco and Navigli ( 2013 ), we evaluated the systems ’ outputs in terms of the snippet clustering quality ( Section 3 . 1 ) and the snippet diversification quality ( Section 3 . 2 ).

Theoretically , the algorithm should also distinguish between all literal senses so that the contexts of the same meaning appear in the same cluster and the contexts of different meanings - in different clusters . Therefore , ideally , the algorithm should solve word sense discrimination and non - literal usages detection tasks simultaneously . For each Russian word shown in Table 3 , we extracted from the Russian National Corpora ( _CITE_ ) several literal and non - literal occurences .

Consequently , the tasks of identifying and assigning values to temporal expressions have recently received significant attention , resulting in the creation of mature corpus annotation guidelines ( e . g .

In addition , graphical outputs that allow ready evaluation of processed multireplicate data sets and run to run feature comparisons are often absent . Perhaps most importantly , the lack of a true platform - independent quantitation program that could be used across multiple laboratories is clearly lacking , thus limiting the ability for large scale proteomic experiments or direct comparison of data sets from different laboratories and instruments . To address these limitations , we have adapted Skyline , a freely available open source software application ( _CITE_ ), to provide a label - free quantitation tool called Skyline MS1 filtering that efficiently extracts and processes ion intensity chromatograms from MS1 scans of peptide precursors across multiple experiments .

While in this article we tried to summarize the work of agINFRA , the specific aspects of each element has been presented in the numerous publications made from the partners ( they can all be found at _CITE_ ). Page 10 of 11 F1000Research 2015 , 4 : 127 Last updated : 21 AUG 2015 The agINFRA vision was to improve research collaboration and data exchange , but during the lifetime of the project , this had to be limited in creating the necessary building blocks ( e - infrastructure ) for services to built upon ( as for example the new AGRIS ). Hopefully this effort will continue and in the future we will be able to present a number of different end - user services specialized for the agricultural research community .__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce
Table 1 reports the results obtained with PEWA on each individual image for different values of standard deviation of noise . Table 2 compares the average PSNR values on these 25 images obtained by PEWA ( after 1 and 2 iterations ) and two state - of - the - art denoising methods [ 6 , 12 ]. We used the implementations provided by the authors : BM3D ( _CITE_ ) and NL - Bayes ( www . ipol . im ). The best PSNR values are in bold and the results are quantitatively quite comparable except for very high levels of noise . We compared PEWA to the baseline NL - means [ 2 ] and DCT [ 26 ] ( using the implementation of www . ipol . im ) since they form the core of PEWA .__label__Method|Code|Use
A second batch of 16 elite bulls were sequenced by AROS ( Denmark ) on a HiSeq 2000 platform according to the manufacturer ’ s protocols .

The polygonized cortical surface models were then imported into Brainstorm [ 25 ], and the number of vertices was downsampled to 15 , 002 to reduce computational load .__label__Method|Tool|Use
In the tested cases the appearance of the found motifs did not change drastically while varying the Bl penalty within one order of magnitude , so fine - tuning it is not necessary . Instead of specifying the penalty a on the B0 norm of the activations directly , we chose to stop the matching pursuit algorithm when adding an additional assembly appearance increases the reconstruction error or when the difference of reconstruction errors from two consecutive steps falls below a small threshold .

Combining all edges ( SR + LM + SB ) does not influence the results any more , but in any case the hybrid configuration achieves the best overall recall ( 0 . 87 ). In conclusion , our experiments on all four datasets consistently demonstrate that combining Dijkstra - WSA with a similarity - based approach as a back - off yields the strongest performance . The results of these best alignments will be made freely available to the research community on our website ( _CITE_ ).__label__Supplement|Website|Produce
Such a map rendering method produces visual discontinuities and conflicts at the tile borders , which may break the spatial distribution characteristics of features [ 49 ] and reduce the readability and applicability of the role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . Competing interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . PLOS ONE | _CITE_ May 5 , 2017 2 / 26 Tiled vector data model map [ 48 , 50 ]. Therefore , a critical issue for tiled vector E - maps is to join neighboring features with their symbol representation to maintain visual continuity and avoid visual conflicts . To eliminate visual breakage , this study proposes a tiled vector data model for the geographical features that define the additivity of map features and geographical features , partition vector geographical features , and implement map symbolizations to graphically match joined symbolized partitioned features without causing graphic conflicts and losses .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce
Therefore , genes should provide a relevant domainspecific description of documents from the genetics literature . The second indexing algorithm that we describe in this paper , know as the Gene Reference Into Function ( GeneRIF ) Related Citations ( GRC ) algorithm , uses “ GeneRIF ” links ( defined in the paragraph below ) to retrieve neighbors for a query document . To form a specific representation of the document , gene names are retrieved by ABGene ( Tanabe and Wilbur , 2002 ) and mapped to Entrez Gene _CITE_ unique identifiers . The mapping was performed with a version of SemRep ( Rindflesch and Fiszman , 2003 ) restricted to human genes . It consists in normalizing the gene name ( switch to lower case , remove spaces and hyphens ) and matching the resulting string to one of the gene names or aliases listed in Entrez Gene .__label__Method|Tool|Use
For example , target word selection is possible based on co - occurrence relationship extracted from a monolingual corpus ( Suzuki et al ., 2005 ). Furthermore , we have developed a word sense disambiguation based on a monolingual corpus in the target domain , and it has been applied to Japanese - Korean and KoreanJapanese translation systems ( Kumano 2013 , Tanaka et al ., 2014 ). On the other hand , open Asian parallel corpora including ASPEC , NTCIR PatentMT and JPO Patent Corpus _CITE_ are available for the research of machine translation systems . By using the parallel corpora , we have confirmed advantages which apply statistical post editing ( SPE ) to RBMT in domain adaptation ( Suzuki , 2011 ). In the last workshop ( Nakazawa et al ., 2014 ), we participated in Japanese - English and Japanese - Chinese tasks with SPE approach and obtained higher evaluation results than RBMT .__label__Material|Data|Use

As a result , we can approximate any sufficiently smooth bounded function of u arbitrarily well , given sufficiently many training classification problems . To validate our method , we evaluated its ability to learn parameter functions on a variety of email and webpage classification tasks in which the number of classes , K , was large ( K = 10 ), and the number of number of training examples per class , m / K , was small ( m / K = 2 ).

Therefore , computing each li essentially only requires the addition of N numbers from a look - up table . We need to do this for all M = | M | illuminants , where summations for different illuminants can be carried out in parallel . Our implementation takes roughly 0 . 3 seconds for a 9 mega - pixel image , on a modern Intel 3 . 3GHz CPU with 6 cores , and is available at _CITE_ This empirical version of our approach bears some similarity to the Bayesian method of [ 14 ] that is based on priors for illuminants , and for the likelihood of different true reflectance values being present in a scene . However , the key difference is our modeling of true chromaticity conditioned on luminance that explicitly makes estimation agnostic to the absolute scale of intensity values .__label__Method|Code|Produce
