The CMU pronouncing dictionary provides the phonemic representations of English pronunciations with a sequence of phoneme symbols . For instance , the English word KNOX is segmented and tagged as the phonemic representation < N AA K S & gt ;.

In fact , their findings suggest that uncertainty introduced via natural climate variability [ 62 ] should be explicitly included in future climate change assessments in addition to that introduced by the choice of GCM .

If the number indicated that a problematic situation should be introduced , then the Lemur retrieval engine _CITE_ was used on the AQUAINT collection to retrieve the answer . Our assumption is that AQUAINT data are not likely to provide an exact answer given our specific scenarios , but they can provide a passage that is most related to the question .

A simple strategy to adopt is then to prune nodes in sequence : starting from the root node , the algorithm checks which children of a given node v should be pruned by creating the corresponding meta - instance and feeding the meta - classifier ; the child that maximizes the probability of the positive class is then pruned ; as the set of categories has changed , we recalculate which children of v can be pruned , prune the best one ( as above ) and iterate this process till no more children of v can be pruned ; we then proceed to the children of v and repeat the process . We start our discussion by presenting results on different hierarchical datasets with different characteristics using MLR and SVM classifiers . The datasets we used in these experiments are two large datasets extracted from the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) dataset _CITE_ and the publicly available DMOZ dataset from the second PASCAL large scale hierarchical text classification challenge ( LSHTC2 ) . Both datasets are multi - class ; IPC is single - label and LSHTC2 multi - label with an average of 1 . 02 categories per class .

The main advantage was to outsource operations such as web crawling and website quality filtering , which are considered to be too costly or too complicated to deal with while the main purpose is actually to build a corpus . In fact , it is not possible to start a web crawl from scratch , so the main issue to tackle can be put this way : where may we find web pages which are bound to be interesting for corpus linguists and which in turn contain many links to other interesting web pages ? Researchers in the machine translation field have started another attempt to outsource competence and computing power , making use of data gathered by the CommonCrawl project _CITE_ to find parallel corpora ( Smith et al ., 2013 ). Nonetheless , the quality of the links may not live up to their expectations .

Recognition of named entities in natural language text is an important subtask of information extraction and thus bears importance for modern text mining and information retrieval applications . The need to identify named entities such as persons , locations , organizations and places , arises both in applications where the entities are first class objects of interest , such as in Wikification of documents ( Ratinov et al ., 2011 ), and in applications where knowledge of named entities is helpful in boosting performance , e . g ., machine translation ( Babych and Hartley , 2003 ) and question answering ( Leidner et al ., 2003 ). The advent of massive machine readable factual databases , such as Freebase and the proposed Wikidata _CITE_ , will likely push the need for automatic extraction tools further . While these databases store information about entity types and the relationships between those types , the named entity recognition ( NER ) task concerns finding occurrences of named entities in context .

Nonetheless , automatic metrics are far from perfection : when used in isolation , they tend to stress specific aspects of the translation quality and neglect others ( particularly during tuning ); they are often unable to capture little system improvements ( enhancements in very specific aspects of the translation process ); and they may make unfair comparisons when they are not able to reflect real differences among the quality of different MT systems ( Gim ´ enez , 2008 ). ASIYA , the core of our approach , is an opensource suite for automatic machine translation evaluation and output analysis . _CITE_ It provides a rich set of heterogeneous metrics and tools to evaluate and analyse the quality of automatic translations .

Similarly to [ 23 ], we collect data from several speakers from the PASCAL ‘ CHiME ’ Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge website . _CITE_ The voice signal for each speaker consists of 4 sentences , which we append with random pauses in between each sentence . We artificially mix the data 10 times ( corresponding to 10 microphones ) with mixing weights sampled from Uniform ( 0 , 1 ), such that each microphone receives a linear combination of all the considered signals , corrupted by Gaussian noise with standard deviation 0 . 3 . We consider two scenarios , with 5 and 15 speakers , and subsample the data so that we learn from T = 1 , 354 and T = 1 , 087 datapoints , respectively .__label__Material|Data|Use
During the calculation we reversed the sentiment orientation of the term if a negation occurs before it . We manually built a negative list : { no , nor , not , neither , none , nobody , nothing , hardly , seldom }. Eight sentiment lexicons are used : Bing Liu opinion lexicon , General Inquirer lexicons , IMDB , MPQA , SentiWordNet _CITE_ , NRC emotion lexicon , NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon10 and NRC Sentiment140 Lexicon11 . With regard to the synonym selection of SentiWordNet , we selected the first term in the synset as our lexicon .

We have used two standard datasets . The first one , RG , consists of 65 pairs of words collected by Rubenstein and Goodenough ( 1965 ), who had them judged by 51 human subjects in a scale from 0 . 0 to 4 . 0 according to their similarity , but ignoring any other possible semantic relationships that might appear between the terms . The second dataset , WordSim353 _CITE_ ( Finkelstein et al ., 2002 ) contains 353 word pairs , each associated with an average of 13 to 16 human judgements . In this case , both similarity and re ll never forget the & apos ; on his face when grin , 2 , smile , 10 he had a giant & apos ; on his face and grin , 3 , smile , 2 room with a huge & apos ; on her face and grin , 2 , smile , 6 the state of every & apos ; will be updated every automobile , 2 , car , 3 repair or replace the & apos ; if it is stolen automobile , 2 , car , 2 located on the north & apos ; of the Bay of shore , 14 , coast , 2 areas on the eastern & apos ; of the Adriatic Sea shore , 3 , coast , 2 Thesaurus of Current English & apos ; The Oxford Pocket Thesaurus slave , 3 , boy , 5 , shore , 3 , string , 2 latedness are annotated without any distinction .

Indeed , by looking at the terms in Neurosynth , that are the closest to the one we use in this work , we find that motor is cited in 1090 papers , auditory 558 , word 660 , and the number goes as low as 55 and 31 for saccade and calculation respectively . Consequently , these databases may also yield inconsistent results . For instance , the reverse inference map corresponding to the term digits is empty , whereas the forward inference map is well defined _CITE_ . Neurosynth draws from almost 5K studies while our work is based on 19 studies ; however , unlike Neurosynth , we are able to benefit from the different contrasts and subjects in our studies , which provides us with 3 826 training samples .

To compute the preference of a word w in the grammatical context of a PMW t ( the target ) towards each of t ’ s possible senses , we consider each relation ( w , R , t ), where R is the grammatical relation . The set C of word collocations are extracted from the BNC and used to compute a preference score Psi for each sense si E S : where supersense ( wj , si ) is true if si is a supersense of one of wj ’ s senses ; isa ( wj , si ) is true if si is a hypernym of one of wj ’ s senses in WordNet , or is a fact extracted from Wikipedia . To determine the supersense and isa relation we use WordNet 3 . 0 , and a set of 7 , 578 , 112 isa relations extracted by processing the page and category network of Wikipedia _CITE_ ( Nastase and Strube , 2008 ). The collocations extracted from BNC contain numerous named entities , most of which are not part of WordNet . If an isa relation between a collocate from the corpus wj and a possible sense of a PMW si cannot be established using supersense information ( for the supersenses ) or through transitive closure in the hypernymhyponym hierarchy in WordNet ( for company and organization ) for any sense of wj , it is tried against the Wikipedia - based links .__label__Material|Data|Use

Inverse predicates do not exist in the OpenLifeData SPARQL endpoints , but rather are simply defined in the OWL logic that defines the entities and relationships in those endpoints .

For our goal , it is essential to normalize nouns to their singular form . This task is non - trivial , because there are numerous words with irregular plural forms and there exist even word forms that can be either the singular form of one word or the plural form of another . By collecting these exceptions systematically from WordNet , we were able to stem most of them correctly with our Plural - toSingular Stemmer ( PlingStemmer _CITE_ ). For the nongrammatical files , we provide a pseudo - parsing , which links each two adjacent items by an artificial connector . As a result , the uniform output of the preprocessing is a sequence of linkages , which constitutes the input for the core algorithm .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The connection to the sense modalities of the words might not be mutually exclusive , that is to say a word can be associated with more than one sense . For instance , the adjective sweet could be associated with both taste and smell . The description of one kind of sense impression by using words that normally describe another is commonly referred to as linguistic synaesthesia _CITE_ . As an example , we can consider the slogans “ The taste of a paradise ” where the sense of sight is combined with the sense of taste or “ Hear the big picture ” where sight and hearing are merged . Synaesthesia strengthens creative thinking and it is commonly exploited as an imagination boosting tool in advertisement slogans ( Pricken , 2008 ).__label__Supplement|Document|Introduce

Unstructured Information Management Architecture ( UIMA ) ( Ferrucci and Lally , 2004 ) is a framework that supports the interoperability of mediaprocessing software components by defining common data structures and interfaces the components exchange and implement . The architecture has been gaining interest from academia and industry alike for the past decade , which resulted in a multitude of UIMA - supporting repositories of analytics . Notable examples include METANET4U components ( Thompson et al ., 2011 ) featured in U - Compare _CITE_ , DKPro ( Gurevych et al ., 2007 ), cTAKES ( Savova et al ., 2010 ), BioNLP - UIMA Component Repository ( Baumgartner et al ., 2008 ), and JULIE Lab ’ s UIMA Component Repository ( JCoRe ) ( Hahn et al ., 2008 ). However , despite conforming to the UIMA standard , each repository of analytics usually comes with its own set of type systems , i . e ., representations of data models that are meant to be shared between analytics and thus ensuring their interoperability . At present , UIMA does not facilitate the alignment of ( all or selected ) types between type systems , which makes it impossible to combine analytics coming from different repositories without an additional programming effort .__label__Method|Algorithm|Introduce

Graph - based methods are amongst the most popular and aim to construct a graph connecting similar observations ; label information propagates through the graph from labelled to unlabelled nodes by finding the minimum energy ( MAP ) configuration ( Blum et al ., 2004 ; Zhu et al ., 2003 ). Graph - based approaches are sensitive to the graph structure and require eigen - analysis of the graph Laplacian , which limits the scale to which these methods can be applied – though efficient spectral methods are now available ( Fergus et al ., 2009 ). Neural network - based approaches combine unsupervised and supervised learning For an updated version of this paper , please see _CITE_ by training feed - forward classifiers with an additional penalty from an auto - encoder or other unsupervised embedding of the data ( Ranzato and Szummer , 2008 ; Weston et al ., 2012 ).

Figure 1 ( a ) illustrates the Z statistic for various pairs of words that range from rather similar words like “ smart ” and “ intelligent ”, to essentially identical word pairs such as “ grey ” and “ gray ” ( whose usage differs mainly as a result of historical variation in the preference for one spelling over the other ); the sample size of bi - grams containing the first word is fixed at m1 = 1 , 000 , and the sample size corresponding to the second word varies from m2 = 50 through m2 = 1 , 000 .__label__Material|Data|Use
The conventional HMM has a large number of covariance parameters because it has a 6 - D output variable ; whereas the CHMM architecture has two 3 - D output variables . In consequence , due to their larger dimensionality HMMs need much more training data than equivalent CHMMs before yielding good generalization results . Our second experiment was with a pedestrian video surveillance task _CITE_ ; the goal was first to recognize typical pedestrian behaviors in an open plaza ( e . g ., walk from A to 13 , run from C to D ), and second to recognize interactions between the pedestrians ( e . g ., person X greets person Y ). The task is to reliably and robustly detect and track the pedestrians in the scene . We use in this case 2 - D blob features for modeling each pedestrian .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

This suggests that it is possible to consistently infer transcriptional regulatory elements , irrespective of the data sets used . This also suggests that cells use a limited number of transcription regulatory elements to adjust themselves to diverse environmental conditions . The combinatorial nature of transcription factors Page 9 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Bioinformatics 2006 , 7 : 330 _CITE_ is one way to ensure an effective adaptation to diverse conditions , and is utilized in many genes . Many researchers have applied the combinatorial nature of transcription factors to the computational prediction of transcriptional networks with great success [ 12 , 27 ].

As long as one head k imagines Q (˜ N , 2 ) & gt ; Q (˜ N , 2 ) then TD bootstrapping can propagate this signal back to s = 1 through the target network to drive deep exploration .

Estimation of kinship coefficients using genome - wide SNP data Before embarking on a detailed comparison of different methods , we explored the use of different SNP sets ( containing different numbers of SNPs ) for estimating pairwise kinship measures , in order to identify a robust set of SNPs that could be used for subsequent comparisons . We considered using either the full genome - wide set of SNPs ( 545 , 433 SNPs ), a ‘ pruned ’ set of 50 , 129 SNPs selected to have minor allele frequencies > 0 . 4 and chosen to be in approximate linkage equilibrium via the -- indep 50 5 2 command in PLINK [ 27 ]), or a ‘ thinned ’ set of 1900 evenly - spaced SNPs that were selected from the ‘ pruned ’ SNPs based purely on physical position using the software package MapThin ( _CITE_ ). In addition to exploring the kinship estimates provided by various LMM software packages , we also investigated those provided by the software packages PLINK [ 27 ] and KING [ 28 ]. KING implements two different kinship estimation methods : KINGhomo ( KING_H ), which assumes population homogeneity , and KING - robust ( KING_R ), which provides robust relationship inference in the presence of population substructure .__label__Method|Tool|Use

MMAP estimation is difficult as it corresponds to the optimization of an intractable integral , such that the optimization target is expensive to evaluate and gives noisy results .

We also collected article titles from Project Gutenberg for segmentation and evaluation . We use the 15th edition gender metadata to identify and extract articles about people from the current edition . In order to identify people articles in the historical editions , we use the Stanford CoreNLP named entity recognizer ( NER ) with pre - trained models , _CITE_ on the first sentence of the article . The common format of a person name is “ last name , first name ” in the 9th and 11th edition and “ last name ( first name )” in the 3rd edition . The first token always serves as the article title and is prone to OCR errors , since it is usually all - capitalized , and in some editions , uses a special font .__label__Method|Tool|Use

In contrast , the proposed compilation to PSDDs does not rely on an intermediate representation or additional boxes , such as d - DNNF or SDD compilers . The benchmarks in Table 1 are from the UAI - 14 Inference Competition . _CITE_ We selected all networks over binary variables in the MAR track , and report a network only if at least one approach successfully compiled it ( given time and space limits of 30 minutes and 16GB ).

We have performed two Reliability Tests in order to 1 ) to check the transferability and applicability of MIPVU , which was originally designed for English , to Russian - language material and 2 ) to assess the reliability of MIPVU on Russianlanguage material by measuring the rate of interannotator agreement . The Reliability Tests had the following setup : – 3 annotators ( PhDs and current PhD students with prior experience in conceptual metaphor studies ); – a collection of 4 text excerpts ( 500 - 600 words each ), representing the 4 genres : fiction , transcribed spoken , popular science / academic , and news texts ; – POS - tagged files from the National Russian Corpus ( _CITE_ ) in xhtmlformat ; – 2 dictionaries used to define the word meanings : ( Dictionary of the Russian Language , 1981 - 1984 , Dictionary of the Russian Language , 1999 ).

In addition , BLUE allows propositions to themselves be arguments to other propositions as a nested structure , e . g ., for modals : ;;; " The man wanted to leave the house " As described earlier , BLUE currently uses two alternative conceptual vocabularies , namely the concepts in WordNet ( with minor extensions ) or the Component Library . BLUE ’ s relational vocabulary is approximately 100 semantic relations drawn from the Component Library . _CITE_ We illustrate our system using an example from Project Halo ( Clark et al ., 2007 ), where the system is used to interpret multi - sentence science questions posed to a knowledge - based system . While BLUE produces a slightly better output for this text using the Component Library ontology , we illustrate it using WordNet ’ s ontology for consistency with our output for the other shared task texts ( we use WordNet for these as WordNet has broader coverage ). We also discuss our system further in Section 4 on additional sentences .__label__Material|Data|Use

The citation data for each publication verified to contain Drosophila - related information are then uploaded into the bibliography of the FlyBase database . Prior to integrating community curation into the pipeline , each new primary research paper was subsequently quickly read (‘ skimmed ’) by FlyBase curators ( Figure 1a ).__label__Material|Data|Use

Here , the difficulty arises when the verbal stem ( e . g ., k ¨ undigen ) is separated from its particle ( e . g ., an ) in German verb - initial and verb - second clause types . As a preprocessing step for target word identification , the text is split into individual sentences , tokenized , and lemmatized . For this purpose , the sentence detector and the tokenizer of the suite of Apache OpenNLP tools _CITE_ and the TreeTagger ( Schmid , 1994 ) are used . Further , compounds are split by using BananaSplit10 . Since the automatic lemmatization obtained by the tagger and the compound splitter are not 100 % accurate , target word identification also utilizes the full set of inflected forms for a target word whenever such information is available .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The graph , as well as the individual intensity profiles , can be exported as a . png , . eps , . pdf and . tif file . For the conversion to the vector format ( eps and pdf ), the user has to manually install respective open - source programs ( Ghostscript at http :// www . ghostscript . com and pdftops at _CITE_ xpdf ). Statistical analysis within the manuscript The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ( KS - test ) is used to compare two samples ( two - sample KS - test ), which tests whether the samples are drawn from the same distribution ( the null hypothesis ). The two - sample KS - test is one of the most useful and general non - parametric methods for comparing two samples , as it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two samples .__label__Method|Tool|Use
The dataset can be found in S6 Data . Flavonoid ions were targeted for MS / MS fragmentation as [ M - H +]- electrospray derivatives with a window size of ± 4 m / z in Q1 .

Details are given below : Landmine Detection _CITE_ consists of 19 tasks collected from different landmine fields . Each task is a binary classification problem : landmines (+) or clutter (−) and each example consists of 9 features extracted from radar images with four moment - based features , three correlation - based features , one energy ratio feature and a spatial variance feature . Landmine data is collected from two different terrains : tasks 1 - 10 are from highly foliated regions and tasks 11 - 19 are from desert regions , therefore tasks naturally form two clusters .__label__Material|Data|Use
While user session segmentation can be improved with more sophisticated algorithms , this simple low - cost heuristic performs adequately for our purposes . We then move on to map queries to Freebase and empirically filter sessions that are less entity - centric . We use an annotation tool especially for short text ( Ferragina and Scaiella , 2012 ) called Tagme _CITE_ to recognize entities and observe only 16 % of all the queries are exactly an entity itself , which means most of queries do have refiner words to convey information need . To ensure the precision of recognized entities , we set a significant threshold and bottom line threshold , queries should have at least one recognized entity with a likelihood above significant level , and those below bottom line are ignored . They are 0 . 19 and 0 . 05 in our work , which may vary with entity recognition method .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Various networks built in BEL were mainly focusing on disease mechanisms ( Schlage et al ., 2011 ) and are used for causal reasoning ( Chindelevitch et al ., 2012 , Huang et al ., 2012 and Selventa 2012 ). Since 2012 , BEL is also available in the public domain through the OpenBEL consortium . The OpenBel portal _CITE_ defines the BEL language standard and provides formatted content and compatible tools for research . The necessary information to develop a BEL knowledge base is currently harvested mainly by manual translation of literature into BEL statements .

Genomes generated as part of the Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ) ( 25 ) and the Genome Encyclopedia of Bacterial and Archaea Genomes ( GEBA ) project ( 26 ) are of special interest . With the goal of characterizing microbial communities found at multiple human body sites , HMP has initially focused on the sequencing of reference genomes from both cultured and uncultured bacteria ( 25 ). Over 550 reference genomes sequenced as part of the HMP initiative , as well as over 1500 genomes associated with a human host and thus relevant to HMP , can be examined and analyzed using IMG / HMP ( _CITE_ ), which is provided as part of the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center ( DACC ). The aim of the GEBA is to fill systematically the sequencing gaps along the bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life .
